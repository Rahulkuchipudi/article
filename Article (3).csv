NEW DELHI: State-run fuel retailers are replacing existing hoardings of central welfare schemes at all petrol pumps with new ones saying 'Modi's guarantee means a better life' - a play on BJP 's poll slogan ' Modi ki Guarantee ' - and a photo of the Prime Minister handing over an LPG cylinder to a beneficiary of the 'Ujjwala' scheme, govt's flagship energy justice programme.Industry sources said managers of all petrol pumps have been asked to ""co-operate"" to ensure the new flex hoardings are in place by Wednesday evening. The message also asked managers to report to respective field officers in case hoarding vendors engaged by oil companies do not report at their retail outlets.Sources said the move is being undertaken on an informal ""nudge"" from the oil ministry and will cost the three main public sector fuel retailers - IndianOil, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum - several hundred crores. These companies own or operate 90% of about 88,000 petrol pumps in the country.Typically, each pump has at least one hoarding of 40x20 size. Larger outlets often have two such displays, while pumps operating on smaller plots have smaller displays. The sources said the oil companies pay Rs 12 per square foot as printing charge.However, these hoarding may have to be pulled down once Lok Sabha elections are announced and the model code of conduct comes into force. In March 2021, ahead of the assembly elections in West Bengal Kerala , Tamil Nadu and Puducherry , EC had, acting on a complaint from Trinamool Congress, asked petrol pumps to remove all hoardings carrying PM Modi's picture.","The message also asked managers to report to respective field officers in case hoarding vendors engaged by oil companies do not report at their retail outlets.Sources said the move is being undertaken on an informal ""nudge"" from the oil ministry and will cost the three main public sector fuel retailers - IndianOil, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum - several hundred crores.

1,"Waitress booked as customers munch on dry ice, get scalded","GURGAON: A waitress was booked on charges of criminal conspiracy and causing damage by poisoning after a group of customers suffered mouth burns from dry ice that was served to them as mouth freshener at a restaurant in Sector 90.Last Saturday, a group of three couples went to the restaurant to celebrate a birthday. After their meal, the waitress offered the group mouth fresheners, but served them dry ice granules instead, which scalded their tongue and palate, police and the restaurant said.Five of the six were injured as they consumed the granules.Three of them are admitted to Aarvy Hospital in the city, and two others have been discharged, police said on Monday.According to the complaint, the couples — Ankit Kumar and his wife Neha, Manika Goenka and his wife Pritika Rastogi, and Deepak Arora and his wife Himani -— went to Laforestta Cafe on Mar 2 to celebrate Manika’s birthday.“After dinner, we were about to leave when the waitress offered translucent granules in a bowl and told us those were mouth fresheners. I didn’t pick one up because I was taking care of my 1-year-old baby,” Ankit, the complainant, said. He said as the others popped the granules into their mouth, they started feeling a burning sensation.“They tried spitting it out and attempted to wash it with water. They vomited and started bleeding. They were writhing in pain, seeking help. I called the restaurant staff, but no one helped us,” Ankit said. He alleged that the group was taken to a hospital after cops reached the eatery 40 minutes later.A video of the incident shows a woman using a large piece of ice while spitting out blood, and three others gesturing as they apparently try to ease the burning sensation.Ankit said he picked up the granules and showed them to a doctor who confirmed it was dry ice. Police said preliminary investigation indicates the waitress “mistook” the dry ice for mouth refreshment.“We came to know that the waitress, by mistake, picked up the pouch containing dry ice instead of mouth fresheners, and offered it to the victims. We have seized the samples of dry ice and sent them for forensic analysis. We will find out why the restaurant has kept dry ice and how the waitress mistook it for a mouth refreshment item,” said inspector Manoj.An FIR against the waitress was filed on Sunday at Kherki Daula police station under IPC sections 328 (causing hurt by means of poison) and 120B (criminal conspiracy).Laforestta Café manager Gagan told TOI, “The waitress made a mistake. We use dry ice to preserve food. We are cooperating with the police.”Dry ice is a solidified form of carbon dioxide that is dangerous if consumed as it converts into gaseous form. It can burn the mouth, oesophagus and stomach if ingested, and in extreme cases, can rupture the stomach. Restaurants and bars often use dry ice separately while serving some dishes, for dramatic effect as it emits vapours, and to also keep the item cool.","I didn’t pick one up because I was taking care of my 1-year-old baby,” Ankit, the complainant, said.

2,Why was Nehru in a rush to recognise communist China?,"Why was Nehru in a rush to recognise communist China?

Vijay Gokhale

TIMESOFINDIA.COM Updated: Mar 4, 2024, 15:19 IST IST

In his new book, the former diplomat takes a look at why India took the lead in recognising communist China in the backdrop of mounting pressure by Britain and a reluctant US. And why the timing, even more than substance, was crucial

On April 1, 1950, India became the first non-socialist bloc country to establish diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China (PRC). But the relationship between the countries did not start off smoothly, as shortly after India gained independence in 1947, domestic preoccupations as well as the civil war that had begun in China meant that the new government led by Jawaharlal Nehru had little scope to craft a proper China policy. It also took a turn for the worse over the status of Tibet .

As communist rule began to seem imminent, with the Chiang Kai-shek government losing major control of the country, the British government set out to engage with the US and its partners to assist in “recognising” and dealing with a new political entity. While India decided to wait and watch at first, the shift in the geopolitical landscape and a desire to carve out an independent role in the Indo-Pacific region pushed Nehru to recognise China. The decision was, the author writes, a strategic one based on his worldview that India and China, as the major Asian powers, had to work together.","Why was Nehru in a rush to recognise communist China?

OTT has lovely stories about common people

The Fifth anniversary of the National Museum of Indian Cinema (NMIC) in Mumbai was graced by the presence of notable dignitaries, including the Consul General of the Republic of Belarus, Aliksandr Matsukou , and Consul of Belarus, Anton Pashkov . The day saw an array of events including a guided tour for visually impaired students from The Happy Home & School for the Blind as well an enriching masterclass by acclaimed director R Balki, in conversation with D Ramakrishnan (GM NFDC).Following the insightful conversation, cinema enthusiasts enjoyed the screening of R Balki 's ' Ghoomer ’.The highlight of the event was Balki’s unabashed take on content clutter, not undermining one’s talent and his penchant for addressing social issues without resorting to social messaging. Over the course of the two-hour session the Cheeni Kum director shared some wonderful insights, funny anecdotes and inspiring words for aspiring actors and filmmakers. Excerpts…I don’t think there is a better film school than going to the set and working with several filmmakers. You learn about life. I was fortunate that I was able to get these experiences, so I didn’t feel the need to do a film school. It’s not that I did it without knowledge, I gained the knowledge. If you can go to a film school, you might probably learn things faster than I did but what you can’t learn is the art of scripting. Scripting doesn’t happen by going to a scripting school because there are a hundredh ways in which you can communicate a story.Cinema is a tool to express a thought or a story that you have. Nobody is going to see the scale or grandeur of your movie if your story doesn’t touch them, isn’t relatable or doesn’t make them think. I prefer the term engaged, over entertained. There has to be an emotional connect. I don’t want people to be bored or switched off or be distracted while watching a film. Entertainment can be mistaken for laughing, dancing, jumping. People want to be engaged while watching a film. When I did the Surf Excel commercial, people told me, ‘Everyone’s preaching hygiene and you are saying get dirty (daag acche hai)’! I feel if you are confident about yourself, you will celebrate your enemy. If you have the ability to defend yourself and remove the stains, why would you curse the stains? I am confident enough to celebrate my enemy which is dirt here so come get dirty. I believe cinema is also like that.I remember I had gone to Amitji’s house during Cheeni Kum. Abhishek was there with him, and he was saying some extremely wise things, which is rare (smiles). He is usually the one who cracks jokes. Amitji was pulling his leg by saying ridiculous things. They were completely opposite to their (father-son) character. I looked at them and said, “who is whose dad!” That thought stayed with me. I knew I wanted to make a film where I will reverse their roles. That’s how Paa happened.Terms like ‘meaningful messaging’ scare me. If you want to look for meaning in life, go to a meditation app. Why watch a film? You need to be clear about your ambition from the beginning. My thoughts in cinema have been far more frivolous than my thoughts in ads. I always think cinema is serious so why not start with a frivolous thought? Even in Padman , my thought was not to convey a social cause. I don’t have a single social cause bone in my body. The film did a lot for menstrual hygiene and awareness, but I didn’t make it for that. I got to make a commercial feature film where the hero of the film was a sanitary napkin. I told Akshay that though he was the hero of the film, the actual hero was a sanitary pad. A filmmaker needs to be honest. I am not here to change the world. I am here to explore an idea that doesn’t destroy the world and gives me happiness. Even a Ghoomer wasn’t about showcasing the infallible spirit of a woman who loses her right hand in an accident and learns to bowl with her left. That’s a cinematic given. People tend to glorify anything that’s social as inspirational. It is an inspiring film; yes, but what’s the speciality in this inspiration? What new can you bring to the table is the trick. I believe when you are down and out you tend to be most creative. The biggest joy in Ghoomer was discovering that new bowling delivery in cricket.I don’t agree with this notion that everyone must work for the film and no individual should want his/her talent to stand out because filmmaking is a group work. I like working with a cinematographer like P. C. Sreeram because he is a rebel who likes to show off. How can you be a craftsman if you don’t want to show your craft off? How can you hire the best man for the job and tell him to listen to you and expect him to curb his instincts for the sake of the story? The story is not driving him. It’s driving the film. I love the arrogance of artists who have faith in their abilities and put their craft first. As long as your craft doesn’t destroy me, please show off your craft. As a director if I ask you to not show off your talent then I am the devil. I am killing your abilities. I love people who are determined to show their abilities. I want people to notice a cinematographer, music director, choreographer, sound-production designer for the right reasons. If people remember you for the wrong reason, then you are doing a shoddy job. You can’t expect the artists to be submerged in the film. If you look at The Godfather, it works because everybody is showing off and delivers their best. That’s why I like working with PC sir and Ilaiyaraaja sir. They are gifted with originality, and they know it. Cinema is all about 'look at me'. When anyone says we need to work as a team and the cause is bigger than individuality, that’s the biggest bull s***. Only when all eleven players try to play their best, will a cricket team succeed.The presentation is a bit understated and subtle but OTT has some lovely stories about common people. I want these films to cut the walk though. I see content where people just keep walking endlessly long after the scene is over. Cut the walk! Someone is standing on a terrace and watching people aimlessly, thinking. Some filmmakers believe this creates an atmosphere. I get it and it’s their presentation but cut it faster.","Excerpts…I don’t think there is a better film school than going to the set and working with several filmmakers.

NEW DELHI: Setting the stage for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections and assembly polls next year, AAP govt on Monday announced in its 10th budget a monthly aid of Rs 1,000 to the capital's women for ""empowering"" them.Finance minister Atishi said ' Mukyamantri Mahila Samman Yojna ' will ensure women in Delhi will not have to seek money from their brothers or fathers for miscellaneous expenses.The scheme will not apply to govt employees, taxpayers and beneficiaries of any govt pension plan.There are over 67L women voters in the city, and the scheme will benefit 45-50L.Though the riders will bring down the number of those eligible, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said at a press conference later that it was likely to benefit 45-50 lakh women. An amount of Rs 2,000 crore has been set aside for this plan.Presenting her maiden budget, Atishi also announced implementation of a ‘Business Blasters’ scheme for university and ITI (Industrial Training Institute) students, on the lines of those in schools, adding that all existing subsidy schemes being run by Delhi govt will continue.“We all are inspired by the life of Lord Ram, and hence we pledged to realise the dream of Ram Rajya in Delhi,” the minister said as she presented a Rs 76,000-crore budget for finan cial year 2024-25. There were 50 references to Ram and 23 to Ram Rajya in her speech.“To realise this dream of Ram Rajya, we have been working day and night for the past nine years in order to bring improvement in the life of every person in Delhi,” she added. She made several references to the life of Ram and read out verses from Ramcharitmanas.It is probably the first time that the size of Delhi’s annual budget has got reduced by nearly 4%. AAP govt had presented a Rs 78,800-crore budget last year. Atishi, however, compared it with the revised budget estimate of Rs 74,900 crore for the ongoing fiscal and emphasised that that outlay had increased by nearly 1.5%.Targeting over 30% of Delhi’s population that lives in 1,800-odd unauthorised colonies spread across the city, Atishi said her govt had made a provision of over Rs 900 crore for improving conditions in such areas. “The life of Lord Shri Ram has taught us that we must think first about those who are the most neglected in society,” Atishi said as she touched upon various works AAP govt had carried out in unauthorised colonies in the past few years.With a large population residing in the city's 360-odd rural and urban villages, Atishi proposed to spend Rs 900 crore for laying down 1,000km of roads. This, she said, will give a “great boost” to the village economy. People living in rural and urban villages directly impact poll results in at least three parliamentary constituencies — South Delhi, West Delhi and North West Delhi.In her 102-minute speech, Atishi spent a considerable time giving details of AAP govt’s works and achievements in its two terms. Instead of comparing the size of the budget, allocations made to various sectors and earnings through tax revenue with those of the previous fi nancial year, Atishi took 2014-15 as the reference year. AAP had formed its first full govt in 2015.Atishi said the capital expenditure in 2014-15 was Rs 7,430 crore and had gone up to Rs 15,089 crore, doubling in a decade. “This growing budget is a true indicator of Delhi's prosperity because in this budget of Rs 76,000 crore, there is not a single penny coming from central govt as a share in central taxes,” she said.As in previous years, the lion’s share of allocations went to education with govt setting aside Rs 16,396 crore — 22% of the total budget outlay — for the sector. In terms of actual allocation, the amount allocated to education witnessed a minor slump of Rs 179 crore.Of this, Rs 5,476 crore will be spent on new schemes, pro grammes and projects, the minister said.An allocation of Rs 100 crore to State Council of Educational Research and Training for training teachers, Rs 150 crore for construction of new schools and classrooms, Rs 45 crore for maintenance of existing classrooms and Rs 42 crore for Schools of Specialised Excellence are some of the major announcements.The allocation for health is Rs 8,685 crore with Rs 6,215 crore being proposed for hospitals to maintain good facilities. The budgetary allocation reduced considerably from Rs 9,742 crore made for 2023-24.Atishi also announced a budget outlay of Rs 6,216 crore for various schemes under social welfare, women & child development and SC/ST/ OBC welfare departments. She announced an allocation of Rs 664 crore for all nutrition-related schemes and said this was one programme which was not spoken about much in the past.The finance minister drew a parallel between Lord Ram and Arvind Kejriwal saying the former had to struggle for 14 years but never backed away from fulfilling his promises. Similarly, the CM, too, had to face many difficulties. “Taking a cue from Lord Shri Ram’s life, CM Arvind Kejriwal has also fulfilled all his promises made to the people of Delhi in the past nine years, no matter how many difficulties he had to face,” Atishi said.She remembered former ministers Manish Sisodia and Satyendar Jain for their “roles in shaping the education and health models” in the capital.","She made several references to the life of Ram and read out verses from Ramcharitmanas.It is probably the first time that the size of Delhi’s annual budget has got reduced by nearly 4%.

This, she said, will give a “great boost” to the village economy.
AAP had formed its first full govt in 2015.Atishi said the capital expenditure in 2014-15 was Rs 7,430 crore and had gone up to Rs 15,089 crore, doubling in a decade.
The budgetary allocation reduced considerably from Rs 9,742 crore made for 2023-24.Atishi also announced a budget outlay of Rs 6,216 crore for various schemes under social welfare, women & child development and SC/ST/ OBC welfare departments.","['rs', 'budget', 'monthly', 'life', 'aid', 'minister', '1000', 'atishi', 'ram', 'delhi', 'crore', 'women', 'govt', 'city', 'hands']",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-budget-hands-out-rs-1000-monthly-aid-to-city-women/articleshow/108220954.cms

11,Did you buy the right yoga mat?,"By: M Kalyanaraman

Yoga for glowing skin: Transform your skin with these simple yoga asanas

The New Year resolutions on yog may be wearing off. But the yoga mat that you bought probably still looks new. Did you buy the right yoga mat? ? Is it enhancing your practice especially at the subtle levels?The yoga industry is worth billions of dollars and spans the entire world, from northern Norway to Antarctica-touching Chile. From adherents through adepts and novices, yog is a practice that draws respect for Indian traditions.Along with the practice, the yoga mat has also become ubiquitous. From suited Wall Street folks on the New York subway to techies dressed in casuals in Silicon Valley – Bengaluru included – the brightly coloured, well wrapped yoga mat draws no curious eyes.For the most part, the yoga mat is just the exercise mat that has not been repurposed all that much. And an exercise accessory designed to take the rough thuds of body parts in the gym is not quite ideal for the subtle transfers of body weight and soft landings of yog poses?If yog is a lifestyle, then the typical yoga mat you find in shops is just not designed for a system that seeks to integrity the body, the mind and the soul. In today’s yog, Indian traditions and ancient texts rule the asanas when they refer to postures, not the asans that refer to the seat.For starters, the synthetic yoga mat that is commonly used contains foaming products. The starting chemical is a foaming agent and the end product is formamide. “Formamide can easily permeate the skin or be inhaled by human body as it’s volatile,” says Swati R, who is doing her PhD on yoga mats at the S Vyasa University in Bengaluru. Formamide is potentially toxic and contact with skin is not recommended.Other synthetic rubber and chemicals used to make rubber mats are PVC, EVA, TPE, Polyurethane and NBR – all skin-unfriendly and release toxic chemicals when exposed to heat. “Eco-friendly cotton, cork and straw mats are recommended for yogic practices,” says Swati.Many schools of Hatha Yog are popular today. They all draw from traditional texts such as ‘ Hatha Yog Pradipika ’, Pathanjali’s ‘Yogasutras’, ‘ Hatha Ratnavali ’ and ‘Gheranda Sanhita’. So, what do these texts recommend on yoga mats? Swati’s research will produce the ideal yoga mat as per traditional yog texts.Meanwhile, she recommends the following when you go to the shop or online to buy yoga mats. “General properties that one should look for are comfort, durability, absorbency, softness, good grip, odour-free and skin- and eco-friendly. The thickness should be 3mm to 5mm, she adds.A definite no is the pungent smell that often accompanies the yoga mat as soon as you unpack it for the first time. A pungent smell indicates vapours are being released by the mat that could be potentially toxic.The Bhagwad Gita can be a quick reference for the choice of yoga mat material. Verse 6:11 in the Gita says: śhuchau deśhe pratiṣhṭhāpya sthiram āsanam ātmanaḥ, nātyuchchhritaṁ nāti-nīchaṁ chailājina-kuśhottaram -- Establishing a firm seat for oneself in a clean place, not too high, not too low, and covered with a cloth, an antelope skin, and kusha grass .Procuring an antelope skin may land you in jail. But kusha grass mats are available in the market.Swati says studies show that practicing yog on kusha grass makes a difference. Energy parameters appear to be more stable and consistent throughout the kusha mat when compared to cotton and rubber mats. “Studies have shown that kusha grass has many medicinal properties. Ayurvedic texts emphasize the use of kusha for healing. Vedic texts also recommend the use of this grass for people performing yagnas and so on. Kusha grass has a beneficial impact on the subtle energies in Vedic rituals and yogic practices,” she adds.","But the yoga mat that you bought probably still looks new.

Fans were surprised to learn that this will be the final season of the famous firefighter series .Shonda Rhimes , the show's creator and executive producer, spoke about the show's last season just days after it was cancelled in December 2023.""I'm grateful for an outstanding run. A heartfelt thank you to the outstanding actors, whose genius brought the characters to life, and to the viewers who continued to make it possible!"" she wrote on Instagram. ""Thank you for the magic, the moments and the memories.""Craig Erwich , president of Disney Television Group, also addressed the decision. ""For seven seasons, Station 19 has been a highlight of the ABC lineup thanks to Shonda [Rhimes] and Betsy [Beers'] incredible vision, beloved characters and compelling storytelling,"" according to a press release released by the network.While there appear to be no new cast members (and the previous season's cast is returning), Station 19 season 7 does have one significant change: it will only be ten episodes long.From final plotlines to firehouse drama, here's what you need to know about Station 19 season 7.The seventh and final season of Station 19 will premiere on ABC on March 14, 2024, at 10 p.m. ET, immediately following Grey's Anatomy.When it comes to this cast, nothing is good news. ABC has not confirmed which cast members are departing the series or who will join for season 7. Station 19's February 2024 trailer hinted that Kate Powell, played by Kiele Sanchez, will have a larger part in the final season.Fans can expect to see the same stars returning for their last season: Jaina Lee Oritz as Andy Herrera, Jason George as Ben Warren, Grey Damon as Jack Gibson, Barrett Doss as Vic Hughes, Jay Hayden as Travis Montgomery and Danielle Savre as Maya Bishop.Other cast members include Boris Kodjoe as Robert Sullivan, Stefania Spampinato as Carina DeLuca, Carlos Miranda as Theo Ruiz, Josh Randall as Captain Beckett, and Merle Dandridge as Chief Ross.The season 6 conclusion of Station 19 was highly dramatic, including Michael Dixon's death, and fans were left wondering who survived the floor fall during the Firefighters Ball.New showrunners Peter Paige and Zoanne Clack haven't revealed much about Station 19's season 7 plotlines, but they have teased plenty of drama. ""We share a similar vision for the show, and we've got some incredible twists and turns planned for the coming season,"" Paige said in an April 2023 statement to Variety.ABC published the Station 19 season 7 trailer at the end of January 2024. The scene in which Gibson collapses at the Firefighter's Ball during the season 6 finale is recreated, with his colleagues and coworkers running to aid him. The scene also hints that the events of Season 7 will continue where the previous season left off.The teaser also depicts Commander Herrera adjusting to her demanding new duty and stating that she will be the ""best captain the station has ever seen.""On February 29, ABC released a longer trailer that hinted at potential crew layoffs, serious problems for the firefighters to resolve, and a possible new romance for Theo with Powell, who had a brief three-episode character arc in season 6.Though the series is set in Seattle, just a few blocks from Grey's Anatomy's Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, the majority of Station 19 is shot in Los Angeles.According to The Seattle Times, the familiar outside of the fire station was shot at Station 20 of the Seattle Fire Department.Paris Barclay, the director of Station 19's premiere episode, told the publication that the series' setting in Seattle was significant to all of the filmmakers.""All our actual locations (in the first hour) are quite disparate and would probably really be handled by different stations, but it's a show and we wanted to be able to see a lot of Seattle,"" he told me.","After months of delays, Station 19 will return to ABC on March 14, 2024, in its original time slot immediately following Grey's Anatomy .

14,Prison no bar for this love story: Court grants parole to gangster Kala Jathedi for wedding,"How sparks flew amid gunshots, and fluent English

NEW DELHI: It was love at first sight for Anuradha and Sandeep . The two had met in the spring of 2020 when the pandemic had just struck. That wasn't their only worry though. Both were on the ""most wanted"" list of police forces of Delhi, Rajasthan and Haryana. For the cops, they were no less than Bonnie and Clyde. In police files, Anuradha was Madam Minz and Sandeep was gangster Kala Jathedi, with a reward of Rs 7 lakh on his head at the time.The two were nabbed in 2021 and Jathedi has been behind bars since then. Anuradha, however, got bail and the two kept their romance alive via regular 'mulakats' through legal channels. On Monday, a Dwarka court allowed Jathedi a custody parole of six hours to get married to Anuradha on March 12, seemingly concluding five years of their own little chase.It was apparently during a visit to the Valley of Flowers while on the run that their love blossomed. For the next nine months, the duo played cat-and-mouse with the police while hopping from Mussoorie to Dehradun to Ranikhet and other places. They were finally nabbed near Saharanpur in July 2021 and sent to judicial custody.However, their incarceration in separate jails didn't let their love die, it seems. Grapevine was Lawrence Bishnoi played the role of ‘best man’ for Jathedi in prison. Several months later, Anuradha got bail and their meetings became frequent.Those familiar with their love story say that Jathedi was smitten with the ease with which Anuradha spoke fluent English and fired bursts of Kalashnikov. “For Anuradha, life had seemingly ended with the death of her former friend — the dreaded gangster Anandpal , who was killed in a police encounter in the summer of 2017. Anuradha then came on the radar of Anandpal’s rival, Raju Basodi. This was when gangster Balbir Banuda lent her support. By 2019, she had come in contact with Bishnoi and eventually became friends with Jathedi,” said a senior cop whose team had tracked down Jathedi and Anuradha in 2021.Anuradha comes from a humble family in Alfasar village in Sikar, Rajasthan. “Her mother died when she was a toddler. Her father, who worked in a government department, brought her up. Her pet name was Mintu which perhaps later earned her the title of Madam Minz,” the officer added.Sources described Anuradha as an educated woman who went on to pursue a Bachelor’s in Computer Applications. Later, she tried her hand at stock trading but the business failed as her partner cheated and left her reeling under a debt of over a crore.Anuradha told cops that she had tried getting help from local police but eventually joined hands with Anandpal to pay her debts through crime. Anuradha has made it clear, to police and in court, that she has no intentions of committing a crime again. For the last few months, she has been living with Jathedi’s elderly parents taking care of them, a gesture which his acquaintances said prompted Jathedi to ask her to marry him. She is also pursuing law so that she can help her husband in court.Monday’s hearing in court saw Jathedi’s lawyer, Rohit Dalal, arguing that marriage was a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution and denying Sandeep the opportunity to marry would violate his constitutional rights.After hearing Jathedi’s legal team’s pleas and police’s response, additional sessions judge Deepak Wason passed an order for a parole from 10am to 4pm and directed the Delhi Police to ensure security. Additionally, Sandeep will be escorted to his village (Jathedi) on March 13 for the ‘griha pravesh’ ceremony, scheduled between 10am and 1pm.Given Jathedi’s reputation, police will send their best men in to make sure Jathedi doesn't try fleeing from custody, a senior cop said.","How sparks flew amid gunshots, and fluent EnglishNEW DELHI: It was love at first sight for Anuradha and Sandeep .

16,"'Insulted', 5-time MLA Tapas quits Trinamool","Decided to leave as TMC is not my cup of tea: Tapas

KOLKATA: Five-time MLA Tapas Roy on Monday severed his 23-year-old bond with Trinamool Congress , resigning from all his party positions as well as the assembly, giving a jolt to the state's governing party in the run-up to the Lok Sabha poll.Roy met speaker Biman Banerjee on Monday afternoon to resign from the assembly and then said he was ""hurt and insulted"" that neither CM Mamata Banerjee nor any other party leader had reached out to him for 52 days after the ED raid on his home on Jan 12.Roy did not specify whether he was joining BJP but BJP seniors told TOI that negotiations were on over ""a parliamentary constituency"". Roy had been gunning for Kolkata (North) Trinamool MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay in the run-up to his resignation on Monday. Roy himself said he he had got ""feelers"" and he was ""a free bird"" now.TMC seemed to have met with a little more success with the other senior, Kunal Ghosh, who said on Saturday he was giving up his positions of party general secretary and spokesperson and then (like Roy) directly attacked MP Bandyopadhyay. On Monday, however, he went to rebel Roy's home to reason with him to stay back in the Trinamool and then, despite getting a show-cause notice from his party, went to Bandyopadhyay's home in the evening after getting a call from the senior MP (see page 5).Trinamool hit back at Roy for ""peddling wrong facts"" and questioning his pre-poll ""timing to vent and quit"". But a section of the party leadership also advised him to ""pause and sit on the reserve bench for some time to think again"" whether he should be joining the BJP.Roy, his aides said, had also got a call from poll strategist Prasant Kishor with the same ""pause before you act"" message. But Roy himself said he ""could not take PK's call"". Assembly speaker Banerjee indicated he was yet to accept Roy's resignation but Roy ruled out any rethink.Tapas Roy had told TOI on Sunday he was “unsure” of his future in the Trinamool. “I resigned from my party posts on March 1. I had told leaders in my constituency on Feb 21 that it was my last meeting with them,” he said.On Monday, after resigning, he said he was “disturbed by corruption and Sandeshkhali”.“A Trinamool leader sent ED to my home on Jan 12,” he added without naming Kolkata (North) MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay. “I watched with dismay that my own party did not speak up for me even when many leaders from other parties did.It has been 52 days since then. The leader of my former party, CM Mamata Banerjee, did not defend me. But she said in the assembly that ED had targeted Shiekh Shahjahan. (So) Shahjahan is more important than me. I felt humiliated and insulted. I have a spine and I have decided to quit. Trinamool is not my cup of tea,” he told reporters outside assembly.State education minis ter Bratya Basu went with Ghosh to Roy’s home on Monday morning. “Both Bratya and Kunal came to my home. It was ironic that when Kunal was sent (to mediate) he got a show-cause notice from Bakshi Da (party president Subrata Bakshi). This is the state of the party; people who work for it are penalised but not those who work against it,” Roy said.Roy has been a Burrabazar MLA from 2001 to 2006 and then a Baranagar MLA from 2011 till date. He was a junior cabinet minister from 2018 to 2021 and later the party’s deputy chief whip in the assembly.Trinamool reacted sharply to Roy’s criticism. “It is a lie that no one contacted him for the past 52 days. The ED seized his phone but party leaders Partha Bhowmick and Shashi Panja went to his home.The party leadership spoke to him but realised he had already made up his mind (to quit),” party spokesperson Arup Chakraborty said. “We have seen people without a spine switch political allegiances quickly after ED raids. But several leaders, including Anubrata Mandal, are still in jail and they have never walked that path.”Party leader Shantanu Sen said Roy may have had “some grievances”. “But why has he opted to vent now when polls are imminent? Is it an attempt to mask a political motive to join another party?” Sen asked.","Roy had been gunning for Kolkata (North) Trinamool MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay in the run-up to his resignation on Monday.

19,Micro Review: Joy of Missing Out by Niharika Nigam,"In ‘ Joy of Missing Out ’, author Niharika Nigam takes readers to the life of Nanki Mehta who is on a journey of self-discovery and reinvention . Set first in Delhi and then Rishikesh, the novel features four main characters - Nanki, her husband, her boss Jaya, and ‘soul-guru’ and a Bungy instructor named River.The story follows Nanki, a 32-year-old Brand Strategist, as she grapples with the suffocating confines of a seemingly perfect life.At the heart of the story is Nanki's need for happiness and meaning in a seemingly mundane, and ‘regular’ life. She has developed a sense of familiarity with her routine existence, but her heart says she wants more. Through her encounters with people like River, the Bungy Jump Master, and the noble efforts of the Dharma foundation in the face of a pandemic, Nanki starts on a transformative journey of introspection and courage.The story beautifully blends themes of existentialism, societal expectations, and the power of human connection in the hardest times. Nanki's inner turmoil and ultimate realisation serve as reminders of the importance of being authentic to yourself and loving yourself even when life turns complex and things seem blurry.One of the novel's strengths lies in its portrayal of Rishikesh as more than just a destination but as a metaphorical bridge to self-discovery. As Nanki immerses herself in the vibrant culture and natural beauty of the sacred space, she finds solace and inspiration in unexpected places.The character development in the novel is also compelling, with Nanki's journey feeling very familiar to readers as she confronts her fears, embraces change, and redefines her priorities. Her relationship with River serves as a ladder to her growth, as he is the one to provide her with fresh, out-of-the-box perspectives on courage, faith, and the pursuit of happiness. River becomes the man who helps her take her leap of faith in both the Bungy ride and her life.Another area that the novel treads on is the concept of not being afraid when it comes to starting something new. In the novel, the news came in the form of social entrepreneurship. When Nanki finds that noble causes are becoming more and less funded owing to the viral disease, she decides to not let go of her journey and rather just tweak it a bit by sharing responsibilities. Nanki's transformation from a corporate professional to a champion of social causes underscores the transformative power of purpose-driven work.In the end, ‘Joy of Missing Out’ is not merely a tale of physical travel but also the emotional and spiritual journey of our now beloved character Nanki towards self-realisation. As Nanki takes her leap of faith, readers are reminded of the universal longing for belonging and the enduring significance of home, wherever it may be found.","In ‘ Joy of Missing Out ’, author Niharika Nigam takes readers to the life of Nanki Mehta who is on a journey of self-discovery and reinvention .

According to the flying training organisation, 40 students have been affected by the said DGCA notification.Flying training aircraft such as Cessna 152 , Cessna 172 are classified as 'single engine aircraft' and the flying training hours accumulated on these aircraft type can be submitted to get a CPL.

The petition alleged that the regulator “suddenly and arbitrarily changed the classification of the said aircraft to Light Sport Aeroplane (LSA)..” in the notification issued on Feb 26. The change in classification made the aircraft unsuitable for CPL training. It argued that earlier the DGCA had approved the Pipistrel aircraft for the training of student pilots for issuance of a CPL, which was why the students trained on this aircraft type.“The DGCA notification has been issued arbitrarily and without application of mind, rendering catastrophic repercussions on the student pilots.. as they have conducted their training on the Pipistrel VIRUS SW 121 aircraft…” the petition said. Based on the said notification, the DGCA had rejected the Commercial Pilot License (CPL) applications of the petitioners, it said, challenging the authority of the DFT in issuing such a notification. “The DFT is not the competent authority within the DGCA for classification of aircraft,” it said.""GATI identified the Pipistrel aircraft as a suitable aircraft for training as it is ‘Type Certified’ aircraft by European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and is approved and used for flight training in Europe including AdvancedUPRT training, for which a very selective number of aircrafts are certified,"" the petition said . It cited '2.1 of the CAR Issue II dated 25 November 2014' which states that each aircraft either manufactured or imported in India for which a Certificate of Airworthiness is to be issued or validated, shall conform to the design standards and be in a condition for safe operation and must be “Type Certified” by the DGCA.GATI said it identified the Pipistrel as a, ‘Type Certified’ aircraft from the website of the DGCA. ""The aircraft’s “Type Acceptance” by DGCA is under the Rule 49E of the Aircraft Rules, vide notification bearing REF No, 7-43/2018-AED dated 29 November 2019 stating that Type Certification granted to the Pipistrel Aircraft vide EASA TCDS No. EASA.A.573 issue 03 dated 12 March 2018 has been considered acceptable by the DGCA in accordance with CAR, Section 6, Series A, Part II,"" the petition said.","MUMBAI: Students of a flying training organisation based in Odisha have filed a petition before the Delhi high court contesting a recent notification issued by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation ( DGCA ).
Under the said order the classification of a particular plane they had trained on was changed to ""light sports aeroplane"".
According to the flying training organisation, 40 students have been affected by the said DGCA notification.Flying training aircraft such as Cessna 152 , Cessna 172 are classified as 'single engine aircraft' and the flying training hours accumulated on these aircraft type can be submitted to get a CPL.
The change in classification made the aircraft unsuitable for CPL training.

BENGALURU: The vociferous support of the Royal Challengers Bangalore fans at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium has been a highlight in the second edition of the Women’s Premier League. Monday was no different and they were treated to a spectacle with Smriti Mandhana (80; 50b, 10x4, 3x6) and Ellyse Perry (58; 37b, 4x4, 4x6) putting on a show to help RCB register a 23-run win over UP Warriorz to end the Bengaluru leg of the competition on a winning note.Put in to bat, RCB, who lost their previous two matches, posted a commanding 198-3 in 20 overs. Warriorz, despite skipper Alyssa Healy’s fine effort (55; 38b, 7x4, 3x6), could only manage 175-8.RCB openers S Meghana (28) and Smriti got down to business without much ado. The duo smashed five fours and two maximums and laid a solid foundation in the Powerplay. But the innings was all about Smriti’s electric 68-minute stay at the crease.The six over extra cover off Rajeshwari Gayakwad in the 12th over reflected the touch she was in. After Smriti was dismissed by Deepti Sharma, Perry changed gears. The Australian hit Rajeshwari for two sixes in the 18th over.Perry, who completed her 50 in 33 balls, followed it up with a six and four in the 19th over of Deepti. The Warriorz’s started the chase with promise with Healy and Kiran Navgire going great guns. They were 46 for no loss in four overs, but after the latter fell, the Australian did not find much support from the other end.The task looked uphill after Healy’s dismissal. Although Deepti (33) and Poonam Khemnar (31) gave their best at the end, they fell short by a distance. For the home side, Sophie Devine, Asha Sobhana, Georgia Wareham and Sophie Molineux collected two wickets each.RCB 198/3 (S Meghana 28, Smriti Mandhana 80, Ellyse Perry 58) bt UP Warriorz 175/8 (Alyssa Healy 55, Deepti Sharma 33; Sophie Devine 2-37, Asha Sobhana 2-29, Georgia Wareham 2-38, Sophie Molineux 2-29) by 23 runs","Brief Scores:BENGALURU: The vociferous support of the Royal Challengers Bangalore fans at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium has been a highlight in the second edition of the Women’s Premier League.

HYDERABAD: Calling Prime Minister Narendra Modi 'peddanna' (elder brother), chief minister A Revanth Reddy took everybody by surprise when he said he would like to see the ' Gujarat model ' implemented in Telangana. Sharing the dais with the PM at a public meeting in Adilabad on Monday, Revanth said he wants Telangana also developed like Gujarat, with rapid strides in various sectors, and sought Modi's help in this endeavour.Sharing the dais with the PM at a public meeting in Adilabad on Monday, Revanth said he wants Telangana also developed like Gujarat and to make rapid strides in various sectors and sought PM's help in this endeavour.""Hamare hisaab se pradhan mantri matlab bade bhai (According to us, Prime Minister means elder brother). Only with PM's help, chief ministers can take their states forward. If Telangana has to make progress, develop and move forward like Gujarat, your (PM's) help is must,"" Revanth said in his speech.While Revanth's remarks may trigger discomfiture in Congress camp, the CM said the state would very much want to contribute to the govt of India's vision of reaching $5 trillion economy and become the third largest economy in the world. Laying stress on Greater Hyderabad as one of the five top metropolitan cities in the country, the CM said the Centre should extend support to the state to take up metro rail projects, Musi river rejuvenation project on the lines of Sabarmati riverfront and encourage semiconductor industry.In a clear departure from his predecessor's approach and exhibiting unusual bonhomie with the PM, Revanth said his govt was not interested in any kind of rift with the Centre but wants to maintain cordial Centre-state relations to improve the state's growth prospects. Any confrontation should be confined to electoral politics but after polls, states will always need the support of the Centre, he said.""I went and met PM Modi after Congress formed the govt in Telangana. I thank the PM for his role in giving approval for construction of elevated skyways on 195 acres of defence land and permission for a textile college. We need continuous support of the Centre,"" Revanth said. He also said: ""We also heartily welcome and thank PM Modi on behalf of the people of Telangana for launching various development projects and laying foundation stones.""Revanth's participation in the PM's programme assumes significance as former CM K Chandrasekhar Rao used to abstain from receiving the PM and taking part in his programmes, despite parties crying foul over 'protocol violation' by KCR.Revanth also submitted a representation to Modi, seeking national status to Palamuru-Rangareddy Lift Irrigati-on Scheme, release of funds, devolution of Centre's share in taxes to state, merger of Secunderabad Cantonment with GHMC, among others.The CM said the state govt will extend full support to NTPC for setting up 2,400 MW power plants as part of the State Reorganisation Act as 85% of power will be given to people of Telangana.Revanth said if the PM puts in a word to Maharashtra govt to give Telangana 1,850 acres of land , the state will pay compensation. The CM said an irrigation project can be constructed at Tummadihatti to provide water to 1.5 lakh acres in Adilabad.

With both candidates well beyond retirement age, the upcoming election is seen as a test for the world's toughest job.The next president will need to navigate global conflicts, address domestic emergencies, and work with a dysfunctional Congress. In his upcoming State of the Union address, Biden is expected to address these challenges and make his case for a second term. However, his approval rating stands at just 38%, with broad discontent regarding his handling of various issues such as the economy, immigration, and foreign policy.Only about 40% of Democrats have extreme or high confidence in Biden's mental abilities, compared to 80% of independents who lack confidence. Similarly, 59% of Republicans are confident in Trump's mental abilities. Despite these differences, both parties agree that the other party's nominee lacks the mental capability for the job.Biden's age has been a point of concern, particularly after a special counsel's report described his memory as 'hazy,' 'fuzzy,' and 'faulty.' Biden has attempted to address these concerns through humor and by highlighting Trump's own gaffes. However, his age continues to overshadow his policy achievements.The poll also revealed that many Americans are pessimistic about their choices in the upcoming election due to concerns about age and cognitive decline. As a result, some voters are considering alternative options and focusing on Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump's potential running mate.The survey also showed discontent with Biden's policies, particularly regarding inflation and the economy. Overall, the poll highlights the growing skepticism about Biden's mental capability among the general population, with concerns about both candidates' ages playing a significant role in shaping voters' opinions. The survey was conducted among 1,102 adults and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.","Approximately 60% of respondents expressed little to no confidence in Biden's mental capability , a slight increase from earlier this year.This sentiment is mirrored when it comes to former President Donald Trump , with nearly 60% also lacking confidence in his mental capability.

52,"Denied flying licence post aircraft rule tweak, students move court","MUMBAI: Students of a flying training organisation based in Odisha have filed a petition before the Delhi high court contesting a recent notification issued by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation ( DGCA ). Under the said order the classification of a particular plane they had trained on was changed to ""light sports aeroplane"". The change in classification meant the flying training hours gained on this particular aircraft cannot be used for procuring a Commercial Pilot License ( CPL ).The petition, by a few students and management of GATI, a flying training organisation in Birasal, Odisha against the DGCA was filed on Saturday. According to the flying training organisation, 40 students have been affected by the said DGCA notification.Flying training aircraft such as Cessna 152 , Cessna 172 are classified as 'single engine aircraft' and the flying training hours accumulated on these aircraft type can be submitted to get a CPL. The problem was with Pipistrel Virus SW 121 aircraft. The petition alleged that the regulator “suddenly and arbitrarily changed the classification of the said aircraft to Light Sport Aeroplane (LSA)..” in the notification issued on Feb 26. The change in classification made the aircraft unsuitable for CPL training. It argued that earlier the DGCA had approved the Pipistrel aircraft for the training of student pilots for issuance of a CPL, which was why the students trained on this aircraft type.“The DGCA notification has been issued arbitrarily and without application of mind, rendering catastrophic repercussions on the student pilots.. as they have conducted their training on the Pipistrel VIRUS SW 121 aircraft…” the petition said. Based on the said notification, the DGCA had rejected the Commercial Pilot License (CPL) applications of the petitioners, it said, challenging the authority of the DFT in issuing such a notification. “The DFT is not the competent authority within the DGCA for classification of aircraft,” it said.""GATI identified the Pipistrel aircraft as a suitable aircraft for training as it is ‘Type Certified’ aircraft by European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and is approved and used for flight training in Europe including AdvancedUPRT training, for which a very selective number of aircrafts are certified,"" the petition said . It cited '2.1 of the CAR Issue II dated 25 November 2014' which states that each aircraft either manufactured or imported in India for which a Certificate of Airworthiness is to be issued or validated, shall conform to the design standards and be in a condition for safe operation and must be “Type Certified” by the DGCA.GATI said it identified the Pipistrel as a, ‘Type Certified’ aircraft from the website of the DGCA. ""The aircraft’s “Type Acceptance” by DGCA is under the Rule 49E of the Aircraft Rules, vide notification bearing REF No, 7-43/2018-AED dated 29 November 2019 stating that Type Certification granted to the Pipistrel Aircraft vide EASA TCDS No. EASA.A.573 issue 03 dated 12 March 2018 has been considered acceptable by the DGCA in accordance with CAR, Section 6, Series A, Part II,"" the petition said.","MUMBAI: Students of a flying training organisation based in Odisha have filed a petition before the Delhi high court contesting a recent notification issued by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation ( DGCA ).

53,"Offence of bribery complete when legislator accepts bribe, rules Supreme Court","Paradoxically, SC allowed prosecution of those elected representatives who had taken bribes but not voted. Writing the unanimous 135-page verdict, CJI Chandrachud said the intent behind Articles 105 and 194 conferring immunity on MPs and MLAs for ""anything said, or any vote given"" in the House concerned was to allow the elected representatives to participate without fear or favour in any debate, ask questions and cast vote, which was clearly intended to improve the health of democracy.Monday's ruling paves the way for prosecution of JMM MLA Sita Soren, who was booked by CBI under PC Act for taking bribes to vote for an independent candidate in the 2012 Rajya Sabha elections. Soren had taken recourse to the 1998 SC verdict to thwart the case against her.The CJI-led bench also tackled the irony in the 1998 verdict which had held that the shield of Articles 105 and 194 was not available to those who took bribes but did not vote. The SC said acceptance of bribes by elected representatives cannot be part of their duties and functions as members of a House and can never be protected by Articles 105(2) and 194(2). ""The offence of bribery is agnostic to the performance of the agreed action and crystallises on the exchange of illegal gratification. It does not matter whether the vote is cast in the agreed direction or if the vote is cast at all. The offence of bribery is complete at the point in time when the legislator accepts the bribe ,"" it said.SC said, ""Indeed, to read Articles 105(2) and 194(2) in the manner proposed in the majority judgment (in PVN Rao case) results in a paradoxical outcome. Such an interpretation results in a situation where a legislator is rewarded with immunity when they accept a bribe and follow through by voting in the agreed direction. On the other hand, a legislator who agrees to accept a bribe, but may eventually decide to vote independently will be prosecuted. Such an interpretation belies not only the text of Articles 105 and 194 but also the purpose of conferring parliamentary privilege on members of the legislature.""Upholding the minority opinion in the 1998 judgment, the 7-judge bench said, ""Offence of bribery is complete on the acceptance of the money or on the agreement to accept money being concluded. The offence is not contingent on the performance of the promise for which money is given or is agreed to be given. The minority opinion based its view on another perspective which was not dealt with by the majority. Minority opinion said act of bribery was the receipt of illegal gratification prior to the making of the speech or vote inside the House.""""Bribery is not rendered immune under Article 105(2) and the corresponding provision of Article 194 because a member engaging in bribery commits a crime which is not essential to the casting of the vote or the ability to decide on how the vote should be cast. The same principle applies to bribery in connection with a speech in the House or a committee,"" it said.The bench said corruption and bribery of MPs and MLAs erode foundation of Indian parliamentary democracy. ""It is destructive of the aspirational and deliberative ideals of the Constitution and creates a polity which deprives citizens of a responsible, responsive and representative democracy,"" SC said.It said the errant elected member, who takes bribes for speaking, asking questions or voting in a House would face double whammy - prosecution under PC Act by law-enforcing agencies and by the House for breach of privilege and discipline.It said actions taken by the House and law-enforcing agencies are distinct and can operate independently. ""The scope, purpose and consequences of the court exercising jurisdiction in relation to a criminal offence and the authority of the House to discipline its members are different,"" the CJI-led bench said.""The potential of misuse against individual members of the legislature is neither enhanced nor diminished by recognising the jurisdiction of the court to prosecute a member of the legislature who is alleged to have indulged in an act of bribery,"" it said.","""The offence of bribery is agnostic to the performance of the agreed action and crystallises on the exchange of illegal gratification.
It does not matter whether the vote is cast in the agreed direction or if the vote is cast at all.

India vs England 4th Test: India beat England, secure 17th straight Test series win at home

NEW DELHI: Club vs country is not a new debate in the Indian cricket corridors, especially every time a new Indian Premier League (IPL) season is around the corner, and the interest of players tilted towards the IPL has often irked experts and former players. Joining that list of critics is ex-India swing bowler Praveen Kumar .According to Praveen, who played six Tests, 68 ODIs and 10 T20Is, the players need to set their priorities right and ensure that playing international as well as domestic cricket is always ahead of IPL in their list.The latest in the list of players who have found themselves in the middle of this controversy are middle-order batsman Shreyas Iyer and wicketkeeper-batsman Ishan Kishan , but with a little twist - it's state vs club instead of country vs club.The duo's failure to make themselves available for their state teams for the Ranji Trophy angered the BCCI to the point that the board issued a diktat making it mandatory for all its contracted players to feature in the domestic cricket. But when Iyer and Ikshan still remained unavailable, the BCCI removed both from its latest list of contracts.Both Iyer and Ishan featured in the ODI World Cup last year, where India lost to Australia in the final in Ahmedabad.In Test cricket, Ishan was last part of the squad during India's Tour of South Africa in December, and Iyer played the first two Tests of the ongoing series against England.TimesofIndia.com caught up with Praveen and spoke about Ishan and Iyer's exclusion from the BCCI's contract, Rohit Sharma as captain, Rohit and Virat Kohli 's importance in the T20 World Cup, and much more.I have been saying this for long.(Earn money, who is stopping you? But it shouldn't be like you are not playing for the country or domestic cricket). This thing is now firmly in the mind of players.(I will rest for a month before the IPL and then play. This happens because mentally you are not willing to let go of that much money). But this is not fair at all. A player needs to balance things. Money is important, but this (giving franchise cricket the priority) is wrong.IPL has given a lot of stars to Indian cricket. The youngsters have got a lot of benefits from this league as they get to share the dressing room and ground with the senior players not just from India but also from all around the world. Cricket has changed a lot. The year IPL commenced in 2008 and now, the IPL has changed, the approach has changed, the game has totally changed now. Support staff has been increased. You spend more than one and a half months with players across the globe, so there is obviously a huge learning experience.Jasprit Bumrah is just exceptional. He stands out and I don't think there are any doubts on his skills that anyone should comment on. He is a senior player now. He has learned how to take wickets at any given time. Akash Deep has impressed me a lot. Mukesh (Kumar) has done well. These two bowlers have done really well and will go a long way. They just need to keep learning new things every day.Rohit knows his role really well. He knows he has to go in the middle and score runs. I don't think it (losing MI captaincy) would affect Rohit in any way because he knows his role well. It won't matter to Rohit whether he is a captain or not. He is a mature and experienced cricketer. I am sure Mumbai Indians management must have spoken to Rohit before taking this decision (giving captaincy to Hardik). Without any conversation and talk with Rohit, MI can't take this big decision.Rohit is a fantastic skipper. He is leading the side really well. Sourav Ganguly was the one who built the team. He created the team with a mix of youngsters and experienced players. Rohit is 'yaaro ka yaar' (friend of friends). He scolds the players when they make mistakes and hugs them too. He guides them and gives them all liberty on the field.","Paisa kamane chahiye lekin aise bhi nahi hona chahiye ki aap domestic nahi khel rahe, country ko importance nahi de rahe.

76,Mumbai crush TN by an innings and 70 runs to storm into Ranji Trophy final,"Brief scores:

NEW DELHI: In a dazzling display of all-round prowess, Shardul Thakur played a pivotal role as Mumbai clinically dismantled Tamil Nadu , securing a resounding victory by an innings and a massive 70-run margin within three days to advance to the final of the Ranji Trophy in Mumbai on Monday.Thakur's remarkable contribution included a stunning century (109) on the second day, providing Mumbai with a substantial lead of 232 runs in the first innings.Not content with his batting heroics, Thakur then led Mumbai's bowling attack, orchestrating the dismissal of Tamil Nadu for a mere 162 in the second innings.Despite Baba Indrajith's valiant effort with a score of 70, offering lone resistance for the visitors, who harbored aspirations of making a significant impact in their first Ranji knockout game in seven years, the rest of the Tamil Nadu batting lineup faltered against the relentless Mumbai side.Once again, Tamil Nadu found themselves losing crucial top-order wickets without substantial contributions, and their middle-order succumbed under pressure.Although the duo of Indrajith and Pradosh Ranjan Paul displayed some resistance by stitching together a 73-run partnership for the fourth wicket, it was not enough to withstand the dominance of the rampant Mumbai team.The catalyst of Mumbai's win was bowling all-rounder Thakur (109; 2/48 and 2/16), who dragged them back into the contest from a perilous state of 106/7 in the first innings to an overall lead of 232 runs with his maiden century across formats.Thakur was all over TN with a two-wicket burst early on day three, helping Mumbai reduce the visitors to 10/3 in the second innings.B Sai Sudharsan was given a reprieve by Shreyas Iyer at midwicket, spilling a sitter in his first over, but Thakur had the left-handed opener caught behind with a superb inswinger that took an inside edge.Thakur swung the new ball dangerously and snaffled the key wicket of N Jagadeesan for a seven-ball duck.Mohit Avasthi also tasted success when he had Washington Sundar, promoted at No. 3, caught behind.With the top order blown away, recovery was a herculean task for TN but the pair of Indrajith and Pradosh Ranjan Paul did well to take the attack to the opposition and keep their side in the contest.Indrajith was back in his usual elements, cracking nine fours to make 70 off 105 balls but his resistance ended after nicking one behind to wicket-keeper Tamore off Avasthi.Mumbai spinners Tanush Kotian (2/18) and Shams Mulani (4/53) joined fellow pacers in piling up further misery on the TN batters, sharing the remaining six wickets to wrap up the win for the hosts.But it was Kotian, who took the initiative with wickets of Pradosh (25) and R Sai Kishore (21) before tea, while left-arm spinner Mulani, who had no wickets to show so far, grabbed each of the final four to return with figures of 13.5-1-53-4.Earlier in the day, Mumbai were bowled out for 378 with Sundar taking the final wicket to break the 10th-wicket stand between Tushar Deshpande (26) and Kotian (89 not out).Tamil Nadu 146 and 162 in 51.5 overs (Baba Indrajith 70; Shardul Thakur 2/16, Shams Mulani 4/53, Tanush Kotian 2/18) lost to Mumbai 378 in 106.5 overs (Musheer Khan 55, Shardul Thakur 109, Tanush Kotian 89*; R Sai Kishore 6/99) by an innings and 70 runs.","Brief scores:(With inputs from PTI)NEW DELHI: In a dazzling display of all-round prowess, Shardul Thakur played a pivotal role as Mumbai clinically dismantled Tamil Nadu , securing a resounding victory by an innings and a massive 70-run margin within three days to advance to the final of the Ranji Trophy in Mumbai on Monday.Thakur's remarkable contribution included a stunning century (109) on the second day, providing Mumbai with a substantial lead of 232 runs in the first innings.Not content with his batting heroics, Thakur then led Mumbai's bowling attack, orchestrating the dismissal of Tamil Nadu for a mere 162 in the second innings.Despite Baba Indrajith's valiant effort with a score of 70, offering lone resistance for the visitors, who harbored aspirations of making a significant impact in their first Ranji knockout game in seven years, the rest of the Tamil Nadu batting lineup faltered against the relentless Mumbai side.Once again, Tamil Nadu found themselves losing crucial top-order wickets without substantial contributions, and their middle-order succumbed under pressure.Although the duo of Indrajith and Pradosh Ranjan Paul displayed some resistance by stitching together a 73-run partnership for the fourth wicket, it was not enough to withstand the dominance of the rampant Mumbai team.The catalyst of Mumbai's win was bowling all-rounder Thakur (109;

78,"Ravichandran Ashwin not afraid of trying new things, that's why he has survived so long: Cheteshwar Pujara","(With inputs from PTI)

NEW DELHI: Known for his astute intellect and an insatiable curiosity for experimentation, seasoned off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin maintains an unyielding commitment to his bowling craft and is always striving to outwit opposing batsmen, said his longtime national teammate Cheteshwar Pujara .Ashwin is all set to mark his 100th Test appearance in the fifth and final game against England in Dharamsala, starting March 7.Ashwin's journey to the milestone Test has seen remarkable achievements. Recently, the 37-year-old surpassed the 500-wicket mark in the third Test in Rajkot, becoming only the second Indian to achieve the feat.""Reading batters has always been a key part of what Ash does. He is always one step ahead, alert to the smallest cues. He is constantly observing the batter... No detail is too small for his sharp mind. He puts a lot of effort into each delivery,"" Pujara wrote in his column for 'ESPNcricinfo'.""Having just become the second quickest bowler to 500 Test wickets, Ash now deserves another equally significant landmark - of 100 Tests. He's probably a little late getting there for various reasons. But I am really happy for him. He is someone who has always been ready to take the challenge on and do the hard yards for the team. He deserves it the most.""He has evolved and survived for a long time despite playing multiple formats, and that is mainly because of his innovative mind: he is not afraid or shy to try out new things, even at the cost of failing in the process.""Pujara, who also played his 100th Test last year but has been out favour currently, said there was no respite for batters while facing Ashwin as he was always on a look-out for taking wicket.""There's no respite. If you're comfortable batting against him from over the stumps, he will change to round the stumps, from where he is able to create that angle where, if the ball goes straight, there's an edge in play even if you are looking to defend.""He is constantly observing the batter, his trigger, where the backlift is coming from, which stump he is on. So if a batter is looking to sweep, Ash will go a little fuller and try and block him by bowling the quicker delivery, almost a yorker length, and get an lbw.""Pujara cited an example of Ashwin's meticulous preparation before a match.""He (Ashwin) has spoken previously about how he obsessively pored over videos of Steve Smith several months before India's tour of Australia in 2020-21. Before the Melbourne Test, I remember we chalked out the plan of having a leg gully against Smith because there was a bit of moisture, which made the ball hold a bit.""And that is the reason Ash ended up bowling with the new ball. Part of the plan was also that he would come round the stumps to create the angle. And the plan worked - I caught Smith at leg gully.""Pujara also had the privilege of ""enjoying up close"" Ashwin's duels against star England batter Joe Root, another fine player of spin. The two are set to renew their rivalry in Dharamsala again.""If you look at his record, Root has always been a proactive batter - he will either try to play the sweep or reverse sweep, or try to rotate the strike so he doesn't have to face six balls off any particular bowler. I'm not saying that Root doesn't defend well, but overall, his game plan is to put bowlers under pressure.""To counter that, Ashwin's tactic has been to keep Root on strike by taking out the short leg or other close-in fielders, leaving just one slip, and placing a fielder at square leg to prevent the single. It doesn't matter whether you are playing on a flat pitch or on a turner, Ash wants Root to defend those six balls and see how he reacts.""It is a battle of wills between two top players, which makes for an engrossing contest.""Pujara also described Ashwin as ""probably one of the fittest I have known"" among the bowlers, ending up bowling 30, 35, 40 overs in a day, but he still has the stamina to carry on next day.Outside of cricket matters, Pujara said ""you can never win an argument"" against Ashwin.""He is very smart, and his vocabulary is probably among the best in the cricketing fraternity.""But Ash is not a bad loser. We play table tennis and tennis - two things in which I enjoy having an edge over him! - and he is a good sport.""I wish I had his incredible memory. That is probably because he has a mind that is always ticking. Away from cricket, he is a voracious reader, enjoys chess online, and is open to learning new things.""","Recently, the 37-year-old surpassed the 500-wicket mark in the third Test in Rajkot, becoming only the second Indian to achieve the feat.
He puts a lot of effort into each delivery,"" Pujara wrote in his column for 'ESPNcricinfo'.

China will struggle with a weakening in the three pillars of growth up to now — the property market, infrastructure and exports, she said. A lack of clarity on China’s policymaking, along with patchy economic data, add to concerns about investing there, Mossavar-Rahmani said.China’s Communist leadership has over the past year emphasized the importance of information security and put curbs on what data can be removed from the nation. The statistics bureau also suspended for a time some unemployment figures. On Monday, Beijing announced that the country’s premier — second only to President Xi Jinping — will discontinue a decades-long tradition of annual press briefings at a key gathering.“It is not clear what the overall general direction of policy will be long term,” Mossavar-Rahmani said. “Policy uncertainties generally put a little bit of a cap on the equity market.”The benchmark CSI 300 Index last month sank to a five-year low amid worries over the state of domestic demand at a time of escalating geopolitical tensions. It has since rebounded after regulators took steps to curb selling and boost institutional purchases.There may be some short-term stimulus measures coming, but China’s real estate sector hasn’t found the bottom yet, according to Mossavar-Rahmani. “Data is unclear — we really don’t have a good grasp of what growth was last year or what growth will be this year,” she also said, echoing concerns among a number of economists who doubt China’s official economic expansion figures.While China formally published a growth rate above 5% for 2023, “most people think that is not the real growth number — it was actually a lot weaker,” she said.“We don’t recommend clients move into China at this point,” she concluded.","“Our view is that one should not invest in China.”She cited a host of reasons for her take, including expectations for a steady slowdown in the economy over the next decade.

102,Elon Musk loses world’s richest person title to Jeff Bezos,"Pay package

For the first time in more than nine months, Elon Musk is no longer the world’s richest person .Musk lost his position atop the Bloomberg Billionaires Index to Jeff Bezos after shares in Tesla Inc. tumbled 7.2% on Monday. Musk now has a net worth of $197.7 billion; Bezos’ fortune is $200.3 billion.It’s the first time that Bezos, 60, the founder of Amazon .com Inc, has topped Bloomberg’s ranking of the richest people since 2021.The wealth gap between Musk, 52, and Bezos, which at one point was as wide as $142 billion, has been shrinking as Amazon and Tesla shares move in opposite directions. While both are among the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks that have propelled US equity markets, Amazon shares have more than doubled since late 2022 and are within striking distance of a record high. Tesla is down about 50% from its 2021 peak.Tesla shares fell on Monday after preliminary data showed shipments from its factory in Shanghai slumped to the lowest in more than a year. Amazon, meanwhile, is coming off its best online sales growth since early in the pandemic.Musk’s wealth could take a further hit after a Delaware judge struck down his $55 billion pay package at Tesla, where he’s chief executive. The decision took the side of an investor who’d challenged Musk’s compensation plan, which had been the largest in history.Options that were included in the voided plan are one of Musk’s largest assets, alongside his stakes in Tesla and SpaceX. The Bloomberg index continues to include them in its calculations of his wealth.The vast majority of Bezos’s fortune comes from his 9% stake in Amazon. He’s the online retailer’s largest shareholder, even after unloading 50 million shares worth about $8.5 billion last month.For Bezos, being atop the wealth rankings is a familiar perch. He first overtook Microsoft Inc co-founder Bill Gates as the world’s richest person in 2017.But a massive rally in Tesla shares left Bezos jockeying with Musk for much of 2021 for the top spot. Late that year he fell way behind, and didn’t regain the No. 1 position until now.Bernard Arnault, 74, the chairman of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world’s largest luxury-goods maker, also ranks among the world’s wealthiest with a net worth of $197.5 billion.","Pay packageFor the first time in more than nine months, Elon Musk is no longer the world’s richest person .Musk lost his position atop the Bloomberg Billionaires Index to Jeff Bezos after shares in Tesla Inc. tumbled 7.2% on Monday.

103,RBI bars IIFL Finance from disbursing gold loans,"MUMBAI: RBI on Monday ordered IIFL Finance to ""cease and desist"" from sanctioning or disbursing gold loans with immediate effect citing multiple "" regulatory violations "".The drastic action comes on the back of RBI finding irregularities during supervision, where the company appeared to be granting more loans than what the security permitted. This was likely to be enabled by deviations in assaying and certifying the purity and net weight of the gold at the time of loan sanction and auction .RBI also prohibited the company from selling its gold loan portfolio by way of assignment, securitisation or outright sale to other lenders.The company had also breached the maximum loan-to-value ratio permitted by RBI. The supervision showed disbursal and collection of loan amounts in cash over the statutory limit and a lack of transparency in charges being levied to customer accounts. ""These practices, apart from being regulatory violations, also significantly and adversely impact the interest of the customers,"" RBI said.Over the last few months, RBI has been engaging with IIFL Finance's senior management and the company's statutory auditors regarding these deficiencies. However, since no meaningful corrective action had been evidenced, the central bank decided to go ahead with the imposition of business restrictions.RBI said the restrictions did not preclude any additional regulatory or supervisory action. ""These supervisory restrictions will be reviewed upon completion of a special audit to be instituted by RBI and after rectification by the company of the special audit findings and the findings of RBI inspection, to the satisfaction of RBI,"" the regulator said.According to IIFL's investor presentation, as of Dec 2023, the company had a gold loan portfolio of Rs 24,692 crore, registering a year-on-year increase of 35%. The company's gold loan business accounted for 32% of its loan book. While digital loans and microfinance loans grew faster, their share in the portfolio was much smaller at 5% and 16%, respectively.""RBI has directed that the company can continue to service its existing gold loan portfolio through usual collection and recovery processes.

104,How a fake number landed UAE fund in tax soup,"MUMBAI: What's in a number? Well, a fictitious mobile number '9999999999' that was entered by Abu Dhabi Investment Authority to enable it to upload its income tax return on the portal, led to I-T authorities doubting the veracity of this entity.Consequently, the commissioner (appeals) upheld tax at 20% on interest income of about Rs 365 crore earned by it from Indian debt securities during FY19. As dividend income was exempt in the hands of shareholders, the dividend of nearly Rs 700 crore was not a subject of dispute.This led to ADIA filing an appeal with the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. As a 'govt' body it was entitled to tax exemption in India, under Article 24 of the India-UAE tax treaty. ITAT frowned on the actions of the lower tax authorities and upheld the tax exemption.Chartered accountants point out that a significant number of non-residents, in the absence of a mobile number in India, have filled in this 10-digit numerical code to upload their I-T return. This ITAT order will also help other non-residents who have or may face tax demands because of this fictitious mobile number entered by them.In their order, the ITAT bench stressed that the tax treaty benefit had been denied on a 'very flimsy ground'. The reason given by the commissioner (appeals) is that the mobile number '9999999999' was indicated by the Truecaller app to be a fraud number. On this basis, the commissioner (appeals) surmised that ADIA is a fraud company, rather it concluded that it is not a company belonging to Abu Dhabi govt.The ITAT bench pointed out, ""Once all other details have been provided, and if that is doubted, then, he should have verified the PAN and the address provided in the return to see whether it is an Abu Dhabi govt-owned company. If he was incapable of verifying then, he should have asked the assessee (ADIA)... It is really surprising that the first appellate authority (aka appellate commissioner) will deny the status of govt-owned authority simply by looking up the mobile number in the Truecaller app. Such an approach is to be frowned upon and is liable to be rejected at the threshold.""","As dividend income was exempt in the hands of shareholders, the dividend of nearly Rs 700 crore was not a subject of dispute.This led to ADIA filing an appeal with the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal.

105,"Interim Budget 2024: A trailer of the visionary roadmap for ""Viksit Bharat""","By Ravi Jain

Key tax proposals in Budget 2024:

Retained tax rates:

Waiver of old tax demands:

Extension of sunset clauses:

Tax collection at source:

Extension of Faceless Scheme time limit:

(Ravi Jain is Partner, Vialto Partners. Vikas Narang, Director and Pawan Digga, Manager at Vialto Partners contributed to the article. Views are personal)

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","By Ravi JainKey tax proposals in Budget 2024:Retained tax rates:Waiver of old tax demands:Extension of sunset clauses:Tax collection at source:Extension of Faceless Scheme time limit:(Ravi Jain is Partner, Vialto Partners.

106,Budget 2024 focuses on youth and women entrepreneurship,"By

Naina Lal Kidwai

(Naina Lal Kidwai is Chair India Sanitation Coalition and Chair Rothschild & Co Indía)

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","ByNaina Lal Kidwai(Naina Lal Kidwai is Chair India Sanitation Coalition and Chair Rothschild & Co Indía)Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

And so, at close, the sensex was barely changed - down 107 points or 0.2% - at 71,645 points.Fund managers and analysts, however, are bullish on the market from long-term implications of the Budget and the direction at which the economy is expected to move.""Government's commitment on fiscal consolidation and focus on supply augmentation (would) bolster macro-economic stability and spell good news for bond markets and debt mutual funds,"" said Navneet Munot , MD & CEO, HDFC Mutual Fund.

ITAT frowned on the actions of the lower tax authorities and upheld the tax exemption.Chartered accountants point out that a significant number of non-residents, in the absence of a mobile number in India, have filled in this 10-digit numerical code to upload their I-T return. This ITAT order will also help other non-residents who have or may face tax demands because of this fictitious mobile number entered by them.In their order, the ITAT bench stressed that the tax treaty benefit had been denied on a 'very flimsy ground'. The reason given by the commissioner (appeals) is that the mobile number '9999999999' was indicated by the Truecaller app to be a fraud number. On this basis, the commissioner (appeals) surmised that ADIA is a fraud company, rather it concluded that it is not a company belonging to Abu Dhabi govt.The ITAT bench pointed out, ""Once all other details have been provided, and if that is doubted, then, he should have verified the PAN and the address provided in the return to see whether it is an Abu Dhabi govt-owned company. If he was incapable of verifying then, he should have asked the assessee (ADIA)... It is really surprising that the first appellate authority (aka appellate commissioner) will deny the status of govt-owned authority simply by looking up the mobile number in the Truecaller app. Such an approach is to be frowned upon and is liable to be rejected at the threshold.""","As a 'govt' body it was entitled to tax exemption in India, under Article 24 of the India-UAE tax treaty.

115,Elon Musk loses world’s richest person title to Jeff Bezos,"Pay package

For the first time in more than nine months, Elon Musk is no longer the world’s richest person .Musk lost his position atop the Bloomberg Billionaires Index to Jeff Bezos after shares in Tesla Inc. tumbled 7.2% on Monday. Musk now has a net worth of $197.7 billion; Bezos’ fortune is $200.3 billion.It’s the first time that Bezos, 60, the founder of Amazon .com Inc, has topped Bloomberg’s ranking of the richest people since 2021.The wealth gap between Musk, 52, and Bezos, which at one point was as wide as $142 billion, has been shrinking as Amazon and Tesla shares move in opposite directions. While both are among the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks that have propelled US equity markets, Amazon shares have more than doubled since late 2022 and are within striking distance of a record high. Tesla is down about 50% from its 2021 peak.Tesla shares fell on Monday after preliminary data showed shipments from its factory in Shanghai slumped to the lowest in more than a year. Amazon, meanwhile, is coming off its best online sales growth since early in the pandemic.Musk’s wealth could take a further hit after a Delaware judge struck down his $55 billion pay package at Tesla, where he’s chief executive. The decision took the side of an investor who’d challenged Musk’s compensation plan, which had been the largest in history.Options that were included in the voided plan are one of Musk’s largest assets, alongside his stakes in Tesla and SpaceX. The Bloomberg index continues to include them in its calculations of his wealth.The vast majority of Bezos’s fortune comes from his 9% stake in Amazon. He’s the online retailer’s largest shareholder, even after unloading 50 million shares worth about $8.5 billion last month.For Bezos, being atop the wealth rankings is a familiar perch. He first overtook Microsoft Inc co-founder Bill Gates as the world’s richest person in 2017.But a massive rally in Tesla shares left Bezos jockeying with Musk for much of 2021 for the top spot. Late that year he fell way behind, and didn’t regain the No. 1 position until now.Bernard Arnault, 74, the chairman of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world’s largest luxury-goods maker, also ranks among the world’s wealthiest with a net worth of $197.5 billion.","Pay packageFor the first time in more than nine months, Elon Musk is no longer the world’s richest person .Musk lost his position atop the Bloomberg Billionaires Index to Jeff Bezos after shares in Tesla Inc. tumbled 7.2% on Monday.

117,World Trade Organization ends meeting in UAE after failing to reach major agreements,"DUBAI: Negotiators taking part in a World Trade Organization meeting in the United Arab Emirates ended their summit early Saturday after failing to reach agreements on several major initiatives, the latest sign of turmoil within the global body.The WTO delayed its closing ceremony in Abu Dhabi by over a day as the 166-nation bloc struggled to reach consensus on fishing, agriculture and other issues.The only agreement of note came on extending a pause on taxes on digital media such as movies and video games. On that issue, the WTO decided to extend the pause until their next biennial meeting.WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala noted that the summit took place ""against an international backdrop marked by greater uncertainty than at any time I can remember.""Like in the summit's opening on Monday, she made no direct mention of Israel's war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. However, she had noted previously the ongoing disruptions to shipping caused by Yemen's Houthi rebels in the Red Sea over the conflict.""The beauty of the WTO is that each member has an equal voice, but that also comes at a cost,"" Okonjo-Iweala said. ""Nevertheless, we are a unique organization, and I think the cost is worth it. Let's keep going so we can make our voices heard.""Elections across nearly half the world's population could bring new challenges for the WTO. None are perhaps more critical for the WTO than the United States presidential election on Nov. 5.Running again is former President Donald Trump, who threatened to withdraw the U.S. from the WTO and repeatedly levied tariffs - taxes on imported goods - on perceived friends and foes alike. A Trump win could again roil global trade.But even if President Joe Biden is reelected, the United States has deep reservations over the WTO. The U.S. under the past three administrations has blocked appointments to its appeals court, and it's no longer operating. Washington says the WTO judges have overstepped their authority too often in ruling on cases.The U.S. also has criticized China for still describing itself as a developing country, as it did when it joined the WTO in 2001.

124,Dollar steady as traders weigh Fed rate cut bets; yen shaky at 150/$,"SINGAPORE: The dollar was steady on Friday after data showed US inflation remained sticky but is easing gradually, keeping hopes alive that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates in June, while the yen stumbled back to the key 150 per dollar level.Bitcoin's blistering rally took a breather and was last at $61,400, near a more than two-year high and within range of the record high.The cryptocurrency surged 45% in February, its biggest monthly gain in more than three years, boosted by cash rushing into exchange-traded funds which were approved and launched this year in the United States.The dollar index, which measures the US currency against six rivals, was at 104.12 after a volatile overnight session following the inflation report. The data showed US prices picked up in January in line with expectations, while annual inflation slipped to the lowest in three years.""The data does emphasise the need for the FOMC to be cautious before beginning to normalise interest rates, especially in the current context of a still-tight labour market,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia strategists said.A string of strong US economic data and recent reports showing persistent price pressures had led traders to rethink when the Fed will start its easing cycle, with the latest expectations that June is likely to be the starting point.Markets are pricing in a 66% chance of the Fed cutting rates in June, CME FedWatch tool showed, compared with March as the starting point at the beginning of the year.Traders are pricing in 82 basis points of cuts this year, closer to the Fed's own projection of 75 bps of easing and drastically lower than 150 bps of rate cuts anticipated when the year began.US central bankers are looking through recent data showing price pressures rebounded last month, and are focusing instead on overall progress on inflation that they say will likely set the agenda for interest-rate cuts later this year.Investor attention will now turn to payroll data next week to gauge how the US labour market is faring.""We need to see something breaking on the data side, either up or down,"" said Rob Carnell, ING's regional head of research for Asia-Pacific. ""Otherwise, there's just no real catalyst for anything to move at the moment.""Meanwhile, the euro was 0.1% higher at $1.08155 ahead of the inflation report from the euro zone that is likely to show a dip in prices, bolstering the case for the European Central Bank to start easing rates later this year.Data on Thursday showed inflation eased in Germany, France and Spain, suggesting that euro zone inflation, to be published on Friday, will show a slowdown to around 2.5% in February from 2.8% January, moving even closer to the ECB's own 2% target.The Australian dollar rose 0.17% to $0.65085, while the New Zealand dollar was 0.09% higher at $0.60925. [AUD/]After a brief bout of strength on Thursday, the yen was back at 150 per dollar territory it has been rooted to in the past few weeks, leading to worries over possible intervention from the Japanese authorities.On Friday, the yen weakened 0.28% to 150.38 per dollar, having strengthened to as much as 149.21 on Thursday after comments from Bank of Japan official Hajime Takata hinted at the need to exit ultra-easy policies.Takata's comments stoked expectations that the central bank could end negative rates in March rather than the widely held view of a move in April.But on Friday, BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda said it was too early to conclude that inflation was close to sustainably meeting the central bank's 2% inflation target and stressed the need to scrutinise more data on the wage outlook.The contrasting comments are likely to keep investors guessing about the next move from the central bank.""It's sort of a 'good cop, bad cop' thing going on in Japan at the moment,"" said ING's Carnell.""I think the markets been getting excited again about the possibility of an April move ... in the big scheme of things, does it really matter if it's April or June?

Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics.

144,Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral.

147,Testify: Sam Bankman-Fried acknowledges 'mistakes' but testifies he did not defraud anyone,"NEW YORK: Sam Bankman-Fried , testifying in his own defense at his fraud trial on Friday, acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.Shortly after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried said he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange.The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team.""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that. A lot of people got hurt - customers, employees - and the company ended up in bankruptcy.""Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried of using FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, make speculative venture investments and donate more than $100 million to US political campaigns. He also faces charges of scheming to cheat Alameda's lenders and FTX investors.He has pleaded not guiltyBankman-Fried's trial, which began on October 3, is drawing to a close nearly a year after FTX collapsed amid a wave of customer withdrawals. The company declared bankruptcy in November 2022 and Bankman-Fried was indicted the following month.His testimony marked the first time the dozen jurors and five alternates have heard directly from the 31-year-old former billionaire after 12 trial days.Bankman-Fried, who was jailed in August after US District Judge Lewis Kaplan found he likely tampered with witnesses, wore a suit and spoke with two water bottles placed in front of him on the witness stand. The former mogul once known for wearing shorts and T-shirts and sporting an unkempt mop of curly locks cut his hair before his trial began.Responding to questions posed by his defense lawyer Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried spoke in calm, measured tones during the first portion of his testimony as he recounted founding Alameda in 2017, shortly after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, despite knowing little about crypto.But Bankman-Fried - who had studied physics and worked as a quantitative trader at Jane Street - said he saw opportunities for ""arbitrage"" in the market for digital assets. He said Alameda's first office was in a small Airbnb in Berkeley, California, before he later moved the firm to Hong Kong.""We wanted to be under the radar at that point in time,"" he said on the stand, adding he named the hedge fund after the California county where it was founded in part so competitors would not discover what they were doing.Jurors have heard from three of his closest confidantes at FTX and Alameda, all of whom have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. They testified earlier this month that they committed financial crimes at Bankman-Fried's behest.For criminal defendants, taking the stand is a risky proposition because it opens them up to potentially probing cross-examination by prosecutors.But given Bankman-Fried's penchant for risk, legal experts say he likely viewed taking the stand as his best shot to counter the allegations made by members of his inner circle, which were backed up by spreadsheets the three said demonstrated how customer funds were stolen and text messages in which they discussed FTX's shortfall of funds with Bankman-Fried.","""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said.

148,Coinbase CEO Armstrong decries rumors of possible US SEC ban on crypto staking,"Coinbase Global Inc.’s head Brian Armstrong escalated his war of words with the US Securities and Exchange Commission , warning he’d heard rumors the agency wants to ‘get rid of’ crypto staking by retail investors.“I hope that’s not the case as I believe it would be a terrible path for the U.S. if that was allowed to happen,” he tweeted on Wednesday, while arguing that the practice of staking is “a really important innovation.”The SEC declined to comment on Armstrong’s tweets.The agency has repeatedly said that most digital tokens are securities that should be subject to its rules. Chair Gary Gensler has previously indicated staking could fall under the regulator’s purview. Armstrong argued that staking is not a security.Staking involves earning rewards by locking up coins to help order transactions on various blockchains such as Ethereum. Coinbase, Kraken and other crypto exchanges have waded into staking products to diversify revenues.The firms let users stake coins, without needing specialist computer equipment nor having a minimum amount of 32 Ether, and take a cut of the rewards. Staking on Ethereum can earn yields of about 6%. Coinbase has flagged the progress of its staking services to shareholders.Last August, Coinbase disclosed that it’s being probed by the SEC over its staking programs. The exchange is the second-largest depositor of staked Ether, according to tracker Etherscan.Armstrong has butted heads with the SEC before, such as over a crypto-lending product that the platform had to cancel due to pressure from the agency.Staking services have gathered steam in recent months after Ethereum — the biggest commercial highway in crypto — switched over to the so-called proof-of-stake method of ordering blockchain transactions in September last year.The next phase of Ethereum’s development, an iteration known as Shanghai expected in March, will allow Ether holders to withdraw their staked coins.Bitcoin uses an alternative computational approach known as proof-of-work, which is widely criticized for sucking up too much energy.Proof-of-stake blockchains accounted for 23% of the total market value of digital assets at the end of 2022, according to a report from Staked and Kraken. The report estimated the value of staked assets at $42 billion.An SEC clampdown could drive investors away from centralized exchanges like Coinbase to decentralized staking services such as Lido and Rocket Pool, which may be harder for regulators to pin down.Lido’s LDO token and Rocket Pool’s RPL rallied after Armstrong’s tweets and are up about 5% and 10% respectively over the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko. That’s even as wider crypto markets sagged Thursday, including a retreat of as much 2.5% in Bitcoin.Coinbase was pummeled last year by a rout in digital assets and the fallout of the collapse of rival FTX. Coinbase’s shares sank about 86% in 2022. They have pared some of those losses by almost doubling so far in 2023 alongside a rebound in cryptoassets.","Chair Gary Gensler has previously indicated staking could fall under the regulator’s purview.

149,"Budget: Budget proposes 30% TDS on net winnings in online games, removes threshold for TDS levy","NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS .In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform. The gaming industry would need to revamp its strategy as these provisions along with ongoing discussions in GST Council could impact the user psyche similar to taxation of crypto currencies introduced in the last Budget,"" Sabnis said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said two new sections have been proposed with respect to online gaming Section 115BBJ to tax such proceeds at 30 per cent and Section 194BA providing TDS on net winnings in the user account at the end of the financial year.""Additionally, certain definitions have been provided such as computer resource', 'internet', 'online game', 'online gaming intermediary', 'user', 'user account' in order to avoid ambiguity,"" Maheshwari said.","NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS .In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.

From his home in New Zealand, YouTuber Danny de Hek assails what he calls a dangerous and deceptive scheme, one rant at a time

Last year, Danny de Hek was a social media guru badly in need of a social media guru. A buoyant New Zealander with geeky glasses, he dispensed advice about how to vastly expand your online audience, to a group of just 350 subscribers.

He earned a living by drop shipping electronics as he searched for ways to make serious money. Then, in February, the husband of a friend sent the 52-year-old de Hek an email crowing about a company that somehow guaranteed outsize and clockwork returns.

151,Bitcoin barrels toward historic January as crypto market jumps by $280 billion,"Bitcoin is set for its best January since 2013 on bets that monetary tightening and the crypto-sector crisis are both ebbing.The largest token is up 39% since the turn of the year, a first-month gain bettered only twice before when crypto was in its infancy. Smaller coins like Solana , Axie Infinity and Decentraland have doubled in value, part of a $280 billion January climb in digital assets overall, CoinGecko figures show.Bitcoin retreated 2.9% to $23,111 as of 10:44 a.m. in New York on Monday amid broad declines in risk assets.The rebound from last year’s deep rout is part of a wider revival in risk appetite on expectations that central banks will slow interest-rate hikes and perhaps even cut borrowing costs later this year as high inflation moderates.The rally in virtual coins has weathered ongoing fallout from the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange — such as the bankruptcy of crypto lender Genesis Global Holdco LLC and a spate of layoffs across the industry.January “feels like a month of new beginnings, with emerging clarity as to bankruptcy proceedings, corporate restructurings and market fundamentals pointing to the bottom being behind us,” wrote Noelle Acheson , author of the “Crypto Is Macro Now” newsletter.Still, there are plenty of skeptics who doubt if the rebound in the likes of crypto and tech stocks will last. One risk is that the soft economic landing markets are hoping for is fanciful because rates must stay higher for longer.The comeback of speculative assets like Bitcoin and the Ark Innovation ETF “will likely reverse” if oil, wages and consumer-price increases shift the “soft landing” narrative temporarily in coming weeks into a “no landing” view, Bank of America Corp. strategists led by Michael Hartnett said last week.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may also remind investors that officials plan to keep rates elevated for some time. He’s due to speak after an expected downshift by the Fed to a quarter-percentage-point hike this week.Some corners of global markets are also flashing warnings. For instance, hedge funds have built up the biggest bearish bet on bond futures on record, clashing with the narrative that a peak in rate hikes is near.For now, momentum is king.

High on the livability index, Thane is one of the top 10 leading cities in India when it comes to housing demand. A 2023 report by Savills Asia Research pointed out that Thane witnessed a significant uptick of 3-8% year-on-year (YoY) on account of consistent demand for completed as well as under-construction properties.Thane now offers a range of options in high-end retail, IT and ITeS sectors, commercial workspaces, hospitality and F&B establishments, healthcare facilities, data centres, and logistics parks. This has been suitably backed by major infrastructure developments.Take, for instance, Majiwada, which is regarded as Thane’s most prime locality. The property prices in Majiwada have experienced a rise of 15.2% in the last three years.Major roads such as the Eastern Express Highway (EEH), Mumbai-Nashik Highway, Thane-Belapur Road, Bhiwandi Highway and Ghodbunder Road converge at Majiwada Junction. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport is just 24 km away. Further, the Samruddhi Mahamarg’s starting point is in Majiwada as well.A slew of mega-infrastructure projects are going to add new dynamics to connectivity soon. For example, Metro connectivity is set to be enhanced through Metro Line 4 (Wadala-Kasarvadavali) and Metro Line 5 (Thane-Bhiwandi-Kalyan).Similarly, the construction of an 11.84-km-long twin-tube tunnel, which is proposed between Thane and Borivali under the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, will reduce the journey from Thane to Borivali and vice-versa by 12 km. Currently, the distance from Thane to Borivali via Ghodbunder Road is 25 km.Currently, the much-awaited 13.2 km-long Thane Coastal Road is in the pipeline and aims to ease congestion off the Ghodbunder Road.Ashar Axis is a 35-storey magnificent edifice that promises unparalleled luxury at an address that is fit for an all-encompassing life. Nestled strategically at the start of Pokhran Road 2 this architectural marvel benefits from the connectivity of Majiwada and the hills views of Pokhran Road 2. It brings every facet of modern living within an effortless reach with its luxurious 1 & 2-bed homes.Ashar Axis was one of Thane’s most successful launches in January 2022 and is gearing for possession in July 2024. That means it just took about 920 days from the launch to its completion – one of the fastest construction cycles in MMR.The project’s key highlights are defined by innovative architecture, impressive accessibility, and exclusive lifestyle experiences—and that is just the beginning.The location of Ashar Axis at Majiwada Junction boasts the widest range of conveniences across education, shopping, leisure and entertainment, and multispecialty medical facilities, which are within a 1km walking radius. The location benefits will further be amplified with the Majiwada metro station coming within a 500-metre walking distance from the project site.Ashar Axis is a boutique residential tower offering 1 & 2 bed luxury homes with lifestyle amenities spread across 25,000 square feet.The double-height, designer entrance lobby tastefully sets the tone for the project. The optimally planned layouts, strategic elevation and naturally ventilated plush apartments have been designed to fit the needs of the modern Indian.All living rooms have a 1-metre-wide sundeck to enjoy the perfect hill view backdrop and enhance utility to accentuate the lifestyle experience. The spacious bedrooms with wardrobe niches are thoughtfully designed to provide ample ventilation and abundant space.Ashar Axis comprises three opulent amenity zones that are thoughtfully curated and designed keeping all age groups in mind.The ground-level amenity zone has a vehicle-free expansive zone dedicated to your kids to explore the wonders of playing outdoors in our adventure zone, kids play area, rock-climbing wall, amphitheatre, toddlers play area and so on. One can foster a personal sense of synergy and happiness at this amenity zone.The club level on the 21st floor is dedicated to wellness and leisure. You can enjoy a perfect sundowner at the infinity pool overlooking the city skyline of foster bonds at the barbeque party lawns. The open-air amenities are supported by a fully equipped gym and dedicated work pods to facilitate the best of the work-from-home life.That’s not all. Listen to your favourite melodies beneath the sky and enjoy a blissful yoga session at the yoga and meditation deck. Enjoy a game of golf for the first time in Thane at the mini-golf arena. Unwind to your heart’s content at the rooftop party deck and sunset cabana seating all on the terrace level.Overall, Ashar Axis is a safe haven with 24x7 monitoring via CCTVs along with the deployment of security personnel across the premises.Since its inception in 2001, Ashar Group has believed that execution and quality are essential to succeed in the business of real estate. When combined with uncompromising values, customer-centric thought processes, robust engineering and transparency in business operations – it makes Ashar Group one of MMR’s leading real estate houses with a portfolio of over 12.5 million sq. ft of ongoing developments and 7.5 million sq. ft of delivered projects.For details, contact: +91 911 2000 631 or click here","This has been suitably backed by major infrastructure developments.Take, for instance, Majiwada, which is regarded as Thane’s most prime locality.

153,"Global foray an option under evaluation, leverage Rs 75k crore USOF for devices, services: Reliance Jio president Mathew Oommen","NEW DELHI: After success in India, telecom major Reliance Jio sees global foray as an option which is continuously under evaluation at the company, a senior company official said.While speaking to the media at India Mobile Congress , Reliance Jio president Mathew Oommen said that India is now a tier 1 plus country and there should be no apprehension in framing policies that are right for the nation.“We think the opportunity for India to go global is big. Reliance will continue to review options to see how best to represent India globally and offer value to customers leveraging the technology capabilities that we have already operationalized in India,” Oommen said.He said that to truly drive the Digital India vision, the government should start leveraging Rs 75,700 crore Universal Services Obligation Fund (USOF) not just for mobile tower deployment but to make devices and services affordable and accessible for individuals.He said Jio Bharat Phone ecosystem is an enabler to 2G mukt Bharat and AI Yukt Bharat.He said that the underutilised USO fund should be leveraged for not just telecom infrastructure but also giving help to individuals for devices and services for those who cannot afford the transition.""Anyone who cannot afford connectivity or monthly rent should be given a device and service model by leveraging the fund,” Oommen said.The government at present charges 8 per cent of telecom companies' revenue as licence fee. Out of this, 5 per cent of the collection is earmarked for USOF which is utilised for promoting telecom connectivity in rural and remote areas.Oommen said that the 5 per cent collection for USOF should be removed and licence fees should be reduced to 3 per cent.“Let the telecom industry use those funds for continued investment. Give these as an incentive to the telecom industry to expand and enhance not just connectivity but for adoption of services by the needy to move to 4G and 5G services. There is no rationale to keep the users in the 2G era,” Oommen said.He said that devices are a very critical equation in the adoption of any service.""We brought the most affordable 4G device and the 4G adoption increased. Now the 5G devices are coming in the Rs 10,000 range and we see more and more and more 5G adoption happening. But we need to get this even lower,” Oommen said.He said that it is critical for the telecom industry to take along 240 million 2G users to grow them and connect them with modern networks.When asked about views on sustainability of the industry with current mobile call and data price, Oommen said the industry should ensure including the whole of India under the Digital India programme at the time of deciding on tariff.“Increasing the tariffs is the easiest thing that one can do but having the right tariff that takes all of India together is what I think as an industry we need to continue to embrace. That's how we will get 2G-mukt Bharat. Otherwise, you will leave over 200 million of India behind,” Oommen said.Talking about satellite communication technology, Oommen said the technology has evolved to a level that it will complement other land-based telecom networks.He said that the spectrum allocation methodology for mobile networks and satellites should be the same.“We absolutely believe, since satellite offers the same services, to the same devices, to the same customers with similar standards, why should it be considered any different. There seems to be no logic at all. Anything other than auction of the spectrum will distort the market significantly,” Oommen said.He said that Jio has demonstrated gigabit speed using satellite communications technology which is no different from the speed that can be transmitted on land based networks.","Give these as an incentive to the telecom industry to expand and enhance not just connectivity but for adoption of services by the needy to move to 4G and 5G services.

162,Ashwin always trying to find ways to get you out: Joe Root,"India vs England 4th Test: India beat England, secure 17th straight Test series win at home

(With inputs from PTI)

NEW DELHI: Expressing deep admiration for Ravichandran Ashwin 's formidable skills, aggressive mindset and unwavering commitment to taking wickets, England's senior batter Joe Root emphasized that the veteran Indian off-spinner poses a constant threat, displaying a distinct lack of belief in the traditional concept of wearing down the opposition.Ashwin, having recently achieved the remarkable feat of surpassing 500 wickets in the traditional format, joins the elite company of Anil Kumble as only the second Indian to accomplish this milestone.As he gears up to play his 100th Test match during the upcoming fifth match against England, commencing on March 7 in Dharamshala, Ashwin's prowess continues to command respect and attention on the cricketing stage.""Ashwin is always trying to find ways of getting you out rather than trying to wear you down, over long periods of time,"" Root said on Sky Sports cricket podcast hosted by former England captains Mike Atherton andNasser Hussain .Root, presently on a break along with his teammates in the series, highlighted the multitude of variations in Ashwin's bowling, creating a constant challenge for batsmen as they are kept guessing by the veteran off-spinner.""He uses creases differently from traditional off-spinners. He uses over-spin, side-spin, can get really tight to the stumps, can go wider and he has got the carrom ball, you know, a lot of different tricks.""So, you will have to be really wary of different threats that he poses and make sure that you have very good skill sets to counter (him) and be on top of him,"" said the ex-England skipper.Offering a glimpse into Ashwin's approach, Root explained that the cricketer from Tamil Nadu frequently deploys six different deliveries within a single over.""Ashwin is making sure that you don't play the previous ball. He is very good at trying to drag you across the crease and get your head to one side of it and beat both edges quite frequently,"" he said.Root said Ashwin poses different threats while bowling with new and old balls.""There are different things to contend with because of his seam position and how cleverly he can move around the shiny side that has got some extra skid.""So, you have to make sure that you are in position a little bit quicker. He can also drift the ball away and bring the slip fielder into play,"" he explained.Root also offered a comparison between Ashwin and Nathan Lyon, the other premier off-spinner of this generation. The 36-year-old Australian has taken 527 wickets from 128 Tests.""With Lyon it is all about, I think, especially in the first half of the Test match, to get over the top of the ball, get the bowl bounce, knee roll high, in between and try to bring short leg and leg slip into the game as much as he can.""Then just slowly, get slower with his pace and drift wider into that. There are those footmarks, you know, Mitchell Starc has so kindly done for him for such a long period of time,"" added Root.England's much-talked-about 'Bazball' approach has not really worked in this series against India, where the visitors are currently trailing 1-3.But Root said frustration has not seeped into the England camp as yet.""Don't think there is too much frustration within the team. Our top order has been far more consistent than it has been for long, long years. But this part of the world can be quite tricky to do that (attacking batting), especially in the second innings.""But the bigger picture is not about how we can blast ahead but to find the best in our game. There will be times when we need to play a bit pragmatic, but this team does not regret and we need to learn from every opportunity,"" he detailed.Jonny Bairstow , who is set to play his 100th Test in Dharamsala, has struggled with the bat, managing just 170 runs from four Tests and he is yet to score even a fifty.However, Root backed his fellow Yorkshire man to come good sooner than later.""I came across him when he was 12 at a Yorkshire scholarship programme with the rest of the boys. He was a superstar even then and had this tough task of living up to the name of his father (former England wicketkeeper David Bairstow).""But Jonny has always excelled and went from strength to strength. He wears his emotions on his sleeve,"" said Root.","""Ashwin is making sure that you don't play the previous ball.

164,"India vs Australia, 5th T20I: Bowlers come to party for India, help hosts defend modest total and win series 4-1","BENGALURU: Australian cricket team’s 10-week Indian sojourn ended on Sunday and it felt like the home batsmen were determined to hand them a farewell gift. But the bowlers were clearly not in a generous mood. Led by a fine show by the bowlers led by young spinner Ravi Bishnoi (2/29), India pulled off a six-run win to wrap up the five-match T20 series 4-1 on Sunday.India skipper Suryakumar lost the toss again and was invited to bat. After a series of misfires, India found saviours in Shreyas Iyer (53; 37b; 5x4; 2x6) and cameo stars Jitesh Sharma (24) and Axar Patel (31). Restricted to 160/8, India defended the total as Australia finished with 154/8. At one point, the away side were relatively untroubled in the chase with Ben McDermott (54; 36b) having a go at the bowlers.But Indian pacers turned on the heat in the 14th over and Mukesh Kumar (3/32) with twin strikes of Matthew Short and Ben Dwarshuis in the 17th over changed the course of the match. Also, Mukesh bowled a seven-run miserly penultimate over and Arshdeep defended the 10 runs required of the last over.The aspirational Indian batting line-up, which in the previous four matches had exhibited a brand of cricket which offered promise and showcased potential, failed to turn up. Instead, most of them looked at sea on a tricky surface which was slow and testing. It was a test of skill and application and the top and middle order, barring Iyer, failed to pass the test.The openers – Yashasvi Jaiswal (21) and Rituraj Gaikwad (10) – played contrasting innings on a surface which was unlike the typical belter the venue offers. Gaikwad struggled to find the gaps and a slow outfield due to rain and overcast conditions didn’t help the cause either.In contrast, Jaiswal heaved a massive maximum off Hardie over midwicket to warm-up for what could have been an innings which could have gone deep into the night. The southpaw, after smashing Jason Behrendorff (2/38) for a six and four, miscued a short ball high into the sky which didn’t go the distance and was taken with precision by Nathan Ellis.Gaikwad joined Jaiswal in the dressing room after just three deliveries. Looking to break free, Gaikwad picked a delivery from Dwarshuis to hit it down the ground, but failed to get elevation or distance and ended up offering Behrendorff a regulation catch.Suryakumar’s (5) dry run with willow in Raipur spilled over to Bengaluru. He was dropped by Ben McDermott, off the second ball he faced. But the big-hitting skipper failed to make use of the lifeline, with his attempted cut resulting in a low catch to McDermott.At the other end, Iyer was unaffected by the chaos. With the scoreboard reading 46/3 in seven overs, it was imperative that Iyer mixed caution with aggression. For a couple of overs after Suryakumar’s dismissal runs dried up. Instead of throwing his bat at every delivery, Iyer, after spending 12 deliveries rotating strike, picked out Dwarshuis to up the momentum.","BENGALURU: Australian cricket team’s 10-week Indian sojourn ended on Sunday and it felt like the home batsmen were determined to hand them a farewell gift.

175,Rohit Sharma opens up on India's World Cup campaign: 'People feeling proud of the team helped me heal',"MUMBAI: Reflecting on the 2023 ODI World Cup , Indian captain Rohit Sharma , in a heartfelt video message for the fans released on @team45ro Instagram on Wednesday, has shared the challenges and emotions experienced during the tournament.From the profound connection between players and fans to the impact of the game, his words resonate with the trials and triumphs of the World Cup journey that all fans experienced.“After the final, it was very hard to get back and start moving on, which is why I decided that I need to get my mind out of this. But then, wherever I was, I realised that people were coming up to me and they were appreciating everyone’s effort, how well we played. I feel for all of them. They all, along with us, were dreaming of lifting that World Cup, along with us,” Rohit said.He added: “Everywhere we went during this entire campaign, there was so much support from everyone who came to the stadium firstly and people who were watching it from home as well. I want to appreciate what the people have done for us, in that one-and-a-half-month period. But again, if I think more and more about that, I feel quite disappointed that we were not able to go all the way.”The team stepping out to represent the country carried a piece of heart of every Indian, shouldering not only their own expectations but also the hopes of fans worldwide.Rohit revealed that fans continued to shower them with all love possible, and make their appreciation known to him in whatever brief moments he came across them.“For me, to see people coming up to me and telling me that they were proud of the team, (it) made me feel good. Along with them, I was healing as well. I felt, okay these are the kind of things you want to hear,” Rohit said.He further said, “People, when they understand what the player must be going through and when they know these kind of things and not to bring out that frustration, that anger, it means a lot for us. For me, definitely it meant a lot because there was no anger, it was just pure love from people that I met and it was wonderful to see that. So it gives you motivation to get back and start working again and look for another ultimate prize.”Rohit has been a cricketer who has seen success par excellence. Years of training, from sweating it out as a young kid dreaming big in the hustle of Mumbai to captaining India at the biggest cricketing stage possible, a sense of intuition, muscle memory seemed to have taken over as Rohit has let his bat dictate proceedings.Rohit walked out each time this tournament with an aura of assurance around him as a leader. From giving impactful starts, to making timely tactical moves that turned games around.“I’ve always grown up watching the 50-over World Cup. To me that was the ultimate prize, the 50-over World Cup. We’ve worked all these years, for that World Cup. And it is disappointing, right? If you don’t get through it, don’t get what you want, what you’ve been looking for all this while, what you were dreaming of, you get disappointed. You get frustrated as well at times,” Rohit concluded.","But then, wherever I was, I realised that people were coming up to me and they were appreciating everyone’s effort, how well we played.

NEW DELHI: Legendary Kapil Dev on Tuesday lauded India's ten straight wins at the recently concluded World Cup but pointed out that excess hype surrounding an almost-certain third title was not needed.As Australia crushed over a billion dreams of India winning a third World Cup title, beating hosts handsomely by 6 wickets in the summit clash, Kapil conceded that the final day was not ours.The World Cup champion also said that fans should refrain from creating too much pressure on the players and treat cricket as just another sport.""Don't keep so much hopes that people end up with broken hearts. We need to keep a balance. Other teams also came to India to compete in the World Cup. We shouldn't create so much hype. We need to look at sports as sports only. Whoever plays good on the day, we need to respect that. We are too emotional,"" Kapil said.India won 10 games, most of which were lopsided as contests, before Australia turned the tables on them at the Narendra Modi Stadium on November 19.For past 10 years, India have lost seven knock-out games out of eight ICC tournaments that they took part between 2014 to 2023. Kapil doesn't know if the pressure of occasion gets to them.""I think today's players can answer how much pressure they feel. We can only feel,"" he said.However there are shortcomings which needs to be taken care of, Kapil stated, without specifying what they were.""If they (India) win it feels really good. There are shortcomings which we need to address. It is not that you won't have shortcomings after a win. What's most important is to rectify them,"" the 63-year-old said.He urged fans to celebrate what India achieved rather than what they missed out.""They (India) won 10 matches in a row. Is it not enough? We should look at other teams as well. We shouldn't compare anyone. What is important is to see whether they played good cricket or not. We played very good cricket. Final day was not ours so be it,"" the 1983- World Cup-winning captain added.Kapil cited the examples of South Africa and defending champions England to prove his point.""We should look at performance of other teams as well like, South Africa, England who were the defending champions, they finished last (seventh).""Kapil also lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi's gesture to visit the Indian dressing room and console the players after the final loss in Ahmedabad on November 19.""If the Prime Minister doesn't encourage, who will? He is the No.1 man in the country and if he supports, it feels good,"" he said.The former all-rounder also refrained from commenting on Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma 's future in T20 Internationals.""This is selectors job and we should leave it to them. It is not good to comment on everything. They are responsible and what they feel good, they should do,"" he said.The second edition of the Kapil Dev Grant Thornton Invitational golf tournament, sanctioned by Proffesional Golf Tour of India, will have prize purse of Rs 2 crore this year, double the amount from last year.Title holder Varun Parikh will try to defend his title in the tournament beginning on Wednesday at the DLF Golf and Country Club here.Kapil said some former cricketers including Murali Karthik, Madan Lal, Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajan Singh are expected to be present on the final day of the event on December 3.He also said he would request Sachin Tendulkar to grace the occasion.""Already the prize money has been doubled. It feels good that some former cricketers will be coming for the event. Why can't cricketers play other sports?""If we can support other sport apart from cricket, why not? In India, there is not just one game,"" said the man, who has been an amateur golfer since his retirement.","Other teams also came to India to compete in the World Cup.

178,Australia exposed India's little chinks in World Cup final: Sanjay Manjrekar,"PM Modi consoles team India in dressing room after World Cup final loss against Australia

(With inputs from PTI)

NEW DELHI: Former cricketer turned commentator Sanjay Manjrekar feels Australia superbly exploited 'little chinks' in India's batting line-up in the World Cup final to secure a record-extending sixth title.The absence of all-rounder Hardik Pandya highlighted a significant 'lack of depth' in India's batting during the final in Ahmedabad last Sunday.India faltered, losing half their side within the 36th over, ultimately getting to a modest 241 in the summit clash.""India felt the pressure of not having depth; you know, those little chinks in India's armour came to the fore,"" Manjrekar told Star Sports.Pandya pulled out of the tournament following a twisted ankle in India's fourth league match against Bangladesh as India were forced to ring in two changes -- Suryakumar Yadav and Mohammed Shami -- for their remaining matches.While Shami's inclusion was a big boost to the bowling attack, Suryakumar continued to have a woeful show in the ODI format. Suryakumar managed just 106 runs in seven innings at an average of 17.67 and a strike-rate of 100.95.""The batting depth wasn't there, and you saw the way KL Rahul played a bulk of the innings with the knowledge that there isn't much batting to come,” Manjrekar said without mentioning any name.""Well, India had certain limitations that they had covered beautifully throughout the tournament, with Jadeja at number 7 and their batting finishing at number 6,"" he added.Manjrekar further said the pressure of the final had a part to play in India's capitulation.""Just imagine this game was a league match between Sri Lanka and India; would India have taken that risk? Maybe yes, that is where perhaps temperament comes in, and maybe, if it was a league match, India would have played differently,"" he said.Former India allrounder Irfan Pathan said it was tough for India because the team was looking behind, absolutely looking behind to Jadeja and Suryakumar Yadav.""And when KL Rahul got out, I think that was the time when India couldn't just go ahead. I thought as soon as they knew that there was no cover, no mid-off, they could have used their feet a bit more and tried to rotate the strike and not allow guys like Travis Head to bowl those two overs crucially in between. Mitchell Marsh bowled one over as well.”Irfan said India lost to a better-planned game.""Australia was a better-planned team. The way they planned, starting from the toss, I don't think any other team could come close to that kind of planning,"" he added.","Suryakumar managed just 106 runs in seven innings at an average of 17.67 and a strike-rate of 100.95.

190,Christmas GK: Was Jesus Christ Really born on 25th December?,"December: Not the month birth month of

Celebrations: The Complete Book of American Holidays

The Interpreter's One-Volume Commentary

When was Christ born?

Why was December chosen for Christmas celebration?

Even though Christmas is now known for its shopping frenzy, its original purpose is to commemorate the birth of Jesus, considered by Christians as the son of God. However, historical evidence doesn't support the idea that Jesus was actually born on December 25th, the widely celebrated date of Christmas.The birth of Jesus Christ remains a topic of intrigue and debate, especially concerning the actual month in which it occurred.Various theories emerge when exploring this historical event. One key element in the story revolves around shepherds tending to their flocks, as described in Luke 2:7-8 of the Bible. This detail, so central to the narrative, has been immortalized in Christmas songs. However, sources such asandpoint out that the weather conditions in late December would not have allowed for shepherds to be actively caring for their flocks. This indicates that Jesus might not have been born during the cold days of December but rather during a warmer season.Furthermore, the journey of Mary and Joseph to Bethlehem, prompted by the Roman census, adds another layer to the discussion. Historical analysis suggests that such a census would have more likely occurred during a time when travel was easier and more feasible, indicating that a low turnout, as expected in winter, would have been inconvenient. This aligns with the idea that Jesus was not born in December, as it would have been an improbable time for a mandatory census that required extensive travel. These details challenge the traditional notion that December is the birth month of Jesus Christ, inviting a reconsideration of the timeline surrounding this significant event in history.Determining the birth of Jesus involves tracing John the Baptist's timeline, with his conception believed to be six months before Jesus'. By this calculation, Jesus might have been born in June, as suggested by the United Church of God, pinpointing June 13 to 17 as a possible timeframe for his birth.December became the chosen time for Christmas due to its alignment with existing pagan festivities. Romans celebrated the winter solstice and the pagan festival known as Saturnalia from December 17 to 25. Saturnalia honored Saturn, the god of agriculture, and marked the beginning of a new solar cycle. Alongside this, Mithraism, a worship practice of the Persian god of light, also held significant rituals during this period. When Emperor Constantine I embraced Christianity in 312, church leaders aimed to merge pagan celebrations with Christian beliefs. They linked Jesus' birth to the winter solstice, citing a symbolic connection between the creation of the world and Jesus' conception. This strategic move sought to ease the transition to Christianity for the Roman population. The decision to celebrate Jesus' birth on December 25 was, in part, an attempt to bridge the gap between differing beliefs, hoping to encourage the conversion of pagans to Christianity.","December: Not the month birth month ofCelebrations: The Complete Book of American HolidaysThe Interpreter's One-Volume CommentaryWhen was Christ born?

192,5 lesser-known tidbits about Napoleon's hat,"Two-Pointed Design

Exaggerated Angle

Made by Poupard

Various Materials

Worn Tilted

In a recent auction held in Paris, a bicorne hat, famously worn by Napoleon Bonaparte during his reign as the French emperor, was sold for a staggering €1.932m (£1.69m). This particular hat is among the estimated 20 that have survived out of the 120 believed to have been owned by the renowned French military leader throughout his lifetime.Napoleon had several hats of the same style, known as bicornes.They varied in size and quality, ranging from more practical, everyday wear to ceremonial or specially crafted pieces for significant events. After Napoleon's exile, some of his hats were collected and preserved. Today, a few of them remain in museums and private collections, serving as historical artifacts. These iconic pieces have several interesting stories and facts surrounding them. Here are 5 lesser-known tidbits about Napoleon's hat .: The defining characteristic of the bicorne was its two points, one at the front and one at the back. This style was popular among military officers of the time for its practicality and distinctive appearance. The two points helped deflect rainwater away from the wearer's face and shoulders.: Napoleon's hats often had a more pronounced angle than typical bicornes. This exaggerated angle contributed to its unique and recognizable silhouette. The design also allowed for better visibility on the battlefield.: Napoleon's preferred hatter was a man named Poupard, who crafted several of his hats. Poupard was renowned for his craftsmanship and attention to detail. While specific details about Poupard's life and interactions with Napoleon might not be extensively documented, his work and reputation as a skilled hatter have been mentioned in historical records and accounts related to Napoleon's attire and accessories.: Napoleon's hats were made from various materials, including beaver fur and felt, showcasing the wealth and status of the wearer.: Napoleon often wore his hat tilted to the side, which became a part of his signature style. This distinctive way of wearing it added to his iconic image. Moreover, tilting the hat allowed Napoleon to have a clear line of sight, particularly on the battlefield. It provided better visibility, enabling him to survey the troops and surroundings more effectively. The tilted sign also carried a symbolic meaning. It was seen as a non-verbal communication of authority and confidence, portraying Napoleon's strong and decisive leadership.Napoleon's hat has been a recurring motif in art and culture, symbolizing power, authority, and historical significance. Despite Napoleon's eventual defeat and exile, his hat continues to be an enduring symbol of an era and a man whose influence on history is still studied and remembered today.","Here are 5 lesser-known tidbits about Napoleon's hat .

193,"Mount Olympus: Greece's highest mountain, steeped in legendary tales from ancient mythology","Mount Olympus in Greek mythology

The environmental ecosystem of Mount Olympus

India boasts Mount Kanchenjunga as its highest peak, and each country has its own towering summit. In Greece, that honour belongs to Mount Olympus, rising 2918 meters above sea level. Nestled between Pieria and Larissa provinces, it marks the boundary of Macedonia and Thessaly. But beyond its height and location, Mount Olympus is steeped in Greek mythology .Exploring its ties to ancient legends and how it was shaped unveils captivating tales waiting to be discovered.Created countless eons in the pastWhen observing Mount Olympus closely, you'll notice its unique microclimate. But what exactly is that? A microclimate refers to specific weather conditions different from its surrounding areas. This mountain's peculiar climate is influenced by its proximity to the sea and its elevation. Scientists believe Mount Olympus formed over 200 million years ago when layers of sedimentary rocks from the nearby shallow sea gathered, shaping its structure. Additionally, glacial movements caused geological shifts, resulting in depressions around the mountain. As temperatures rose, glaciers melted, carrying crushed rocks to the sea and leaving behind a colossal alluvial fan. This fan, resembling a cone-shaped heap of sediment, played a significant role in the formation of Mount Olympus. Over time, these natural processes sculpted this majestic peak, offering a glimpse into the intriguing geological history of this legendary mountain.In ancient Greek stories, Mount Olympus was believed to be the dwelling place of gods and goddesses. According to their tales, this mountain's summit held Zeus's throne, where the Olympians, twelve powerful gods and goddesses, resided within hidden palaces nestled amid numerous valleys. They were thought to live much like humans, engaging in activities and ruling from their respective castles atop the peak.This belief led Greek tribes to name the highest points of various areas Olympus, linking them symbolically to the mountain. Thus, peaks in places like Mysia, Laconia, Lycia, Cyprus, Attica, Euboea, Ionia, and Lesbos were all called Olympus. The ancient Greeks also revered Mount Olympus as the origin of Zeus's immense power, which they associated with supernatural forces. Interestingly, people lived only in the foothills because the mountain's higher regions were believed to be the exclusive domain of the gods and goddesses.Mount Olympus boasts diverse landscapes and a rich array of plants and animals. Its terrain supports Mediterranean shrubs and a mix of deciduous and coniferous trees like willows, alders, beeches, black pines, and vibrant red lilies. Among the unique species is the robolo or Olympus pine, creating lush sub-alpine meadows. Various flowers thrive here too, such as daphne, buxus, juniperus, astragalus, and berberis.The region hosts nine to ten woodpecker species, horned larks, alpine accentors, golden eagles, short-toed snake eagles, European honey buzzards, and the rare wallcreeper. Additionally, it's a haven for over 170 butterfly species. This diverse ecosystem in Mount Olympus provides a habitat for a wide range of flora and fauna, making it a fascinating and biodiverse area to explore.","Mount Olympus in Greek mythologyThe environmental ecosystem of Mount OlympusIndia boasts Mount Kanchenjunga as its highest peak, and each country has its own towering summit.

With 126 marks in 29th Jan session 2, one has got 90 percentile while the expectation with 126 marks was somewhere around 97 percentile.""Another candidate wrote, ""Recheck the percentile for jee mains 27th shift 1 ,shift 2 and 29th shift 1. This is unfair for the hardworking students who got above 200 still not getting 99%ile.""A father of a JEE Main candidate took to X and wrote, ""My son scored 275 marks in the JEE Mains Session 1 Jan 27 Shift 1 exam, but his %tile was only 99.87.

Ram Mandir inauguration in Ayodhya

UPSC Prelims 2024 is scheduled for 26th May this year. General knowledge plays a pivotal role in cracking this highly-competitive exam, known for its rigorous selection process. A strong base for general knowledge is crucial for several aspects of the exam, including the preliminary, mains, and interview stages. This not only enhances their chances of success in the UPSC exam, but also equips them with the knowledge and insights necessary for a career in public service.For candidates, burning the midnight oil for cracking this national-level exam, here is a round-up of the major events of 2024 in a compact, capsulated form.An explosion at the well-known Rameshwaram Cafe in Bengaluru's Whitefield area has left at least nine people injured. The incident, which occurred between 1:30 and 2:00 pm, was caused by an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) and was apparently intended to create panic. Prior to the explosion, the cafe had reportedly received threat messages. Officials investigating the matter are considering two main possibilities: terrorism and business rivalry. There were signals last week suggesting that rivals might try to damage the cafe's reputation, according to sources familiar with the investigation.During his visit to India, Microsoft Co-Founder Bill Gates met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi. Their discussion focused on harnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI) for the public good, promoting women-led development, and fostering innovation in health, climate adaptation, and agriculture. Both leaders reiterated their commitment to sectors that have the potential to improve the planet and empower millions of people globally. Before meeting the Prime Minister, Gates also met with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on February 29, where they exchanged books.ISRO's Gaganyaan mission marks India's ambitious foray into human spaceflight. it aims to send Indian astronauts into space, making India the fourth nation to independently conduct manned space missions. Gaganyaan will consist of a crew module, service module, and a launch vehicle. Recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has revealed the names of the astronauts chosen for India's inaugural three-day space mission. The selected astronauts, who will undergo training at Bengaluru's Astronaut Training Facility, are Group Captain Prashanth Nair, Group Captains Ajit Krishnan and Angad Prathap, and Wing Commander Shubhanshu Shukla. Training for the astronauts includes survival techniques, parabolic flights, and simulations.On March 1, the Finance Ministry announced that the Financial Intelligence Unit-India (FIU-IND) has fined Paytm Payments Bank Rs 5.49 crore for failing to comply with anti-money laundering rules. The FIU-India launched an investigation into the bank based on information from law enforcement agencies regarding certain entities and their illicit activities. It was found that funds from these illegal operations were funneled through bank accounts held by these entities with Paytm Payments Bank.The inauguration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya on 22nd January 2024 marked the culmination of a 200-year-old saga that left a profound impact on India's socio-political landscape. The temple, constructed in the traditional Nagara style, stands as a testament to exquisite craftsmanship, featuring pink sandstone sourced from Mirzapur and the hills of Bansi-Paharpur in Rajasthan. Spanning an expansive 71 acres, the temple is a marvel of architecture, with its main area covering 2.67 acres, adorned with 390 pillars, 46 doorways, and 5 mandaps.Inside the temple, the main Garbh Griha houses the idols of Ram Lalla, accompanied by intricately designed mandaps, including the Rang Mandap and Nritya Mandap. One of the temple's unique features is its innovative anointment tradition, where on every Ram Navami at noon, a system of mirrors and lenses focuses the sun's rays on Ram Lalla’s idol, a process that requires no electricity and utilizes brass instead of iron or steel.Crafted by Mysuru sculptor Arun Yogiraj, the idol of five-year-old Ram Lalla stands at 51 inches and was consecrated in a special ceremony. Notably, the temple's construction has been devoid of iron, ensuring its durability for at least a millennium. The Nagara style of temple architecture, which emerged in the 5th century CE during the late Gupta period in northern India, is showcased in this temple, contrasting with the Dravida style of southern India, which also emerged in the same period. The completion of the Ram temple in Ayodhya signifies not just an architectural marvel but also a cultural and religious milestone, fulfilling the aspirations of millions of devotees.","Major blast at Bengaluru’s Rameshwaram caféBill Gates met PM ModiAstronauts for ISRO's Gaganyaan mission announcedPaytm Payments Bank penalized with a fine of Rs.

243,CBSE May Introduce Open Book Exams: 5 Merits and Demerits of OBE,"Discussion Unveils Both Enthusiasm and Concerns Over OBE Implementation

Merits of Open Book Exams (OBE)

Demerits of Open Book Exams (OBE)

NEW DELHI: In a landmark move, the Central Board of Secondary Education ( CBSE ) convened in December 2023 to deliberate on the implementation of open book exams (OBE) for classes 9-12. The proposal, aimed at revolutionizing the assessment paradigm, received extensive discussion among education experts and stakeholders.The pilot will be held in select schools in November-December for subjects like English, Mathematics and Science for Classes 9 and 10, and English, Mathematics and Biology for Classes 11 and 12.The CBSE has proposed this form of assessment based on the National Curriculum Framework (NCF) released last year.The Director ( Academic Assessments ) tabled the proposal, outlining plans to develop and pilot OBEs in English, Science, Mathematics, and Biology, aligning with the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCFSE) 2023 recommendations. These tests would undergo rigorous pilot testing in schools to evaluate factors like completion time, suitability for formative and summative assessment, and stakeholders' perceptions. With the proposed timeline envisioning the completion of test development by June 2024 and pilot testing in November-December 2024, the initiative aims to introduce a more holistic approach to evaluating students' knowledge and skills.Professor Jyoti Sharma, drawing from the University of Delhi's experience, reiterated concerns during the CBSE meeting. She queried the board's strategy for adequately training teachers to facilitate open-book assessments among students. Sharma emphasized the necessity for CBSE to be well-prepared to address potential challenges that may arise during this initiative. Additionally, she sought clarification regarding the nature of content CBSE intends to develop for these assessments.The Director of Academic Assessment provided insights into CBSE's approach, highlighting alignment with competencies outlined in NCFFSE-2023. Emphasis was placed on cultivating higher-order thinking skills, including application, analysis, critical and creative thinking, and problem-solving. The proposed assessments would integrate visual aids and depart from traditional curriculum-linked case-based questions to explore content beyond syllabi. Despite these innovations, challenges remain in developing high-quality textual materials and ensuring student comprehension and acceptance of this novel assessment method.Professor Radhey Shyam introduced an innovative suggestion during the meeting: having teachers undergo the open-book exams first. This proactive approach would enable teachers to understand the intricacies of OBE questions and the potential for multiple answers. By experiencing the assessment firsthand, educators can better prepare students and provide effective guidance throughout the process.• Encourages Critical Thinking: OBEs promote critical thinking and problem-solving skills as students are required to analyze information and apply concepts rather than memorize facts. This approach fosters a deeper understanding of the subject matter and enhances students' ability to think critically in real-world situations.• Reduces Memorization Pressure: Unlike traditional exams, OBEs reduce the pressure on students to memorize vast amounts of information. Instead, they focus on understanding concepts and accessing resources during the exam, which mimics real-life scenarios where access to information is readily available.• Promotes Resource Management Skills: OBEs encourage students to effectively manage and utilize available resources, such as textbooks, notes, and online materials, to answer questions. This cultivates resourcefulness and teaches students how to navigate information sources efficiently, a valuable skill in today's digital age.• Enhances Learning Engagement: By allowing students to access resources during exams, OBEs make the assessment process more engaging and relevant to real-life situations. Students are actively involved in the learning process, leading to increased motivation and interest in the subject matter.• Assesses Application of Knowledge: OBEs assess students' ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical situations. By presenting open-ended questions that require analysis and synthesis of information, OBEs evaluate students' comprehension and application skills, providing a more comprehensive measure of learning outcomes.• Risk of Dependence on Resources: One of the main criticisms of OBEs is the risk of students becoming overly dependent on external resources during exams. This may lead to a lack of genuine understanding and critical thinking skills if students rely too heavily on reference materials to answer questions.• Potential for Inequity: OBEs may exacerbate existing inequalities among students, as not all students have equal access to resources such as textbooks, notes, or online materials. Students from disadvantaged backgrounds or with limited access to resources may be at a disadvantage compared to their peers.• Time Management Challenges: OBEs require strong time management skills to navigate through resources and answer questions within the allotted time frame. Students who struggle with time management may find it challenging to locate relevant information quickly and efficiently, potentially impacting their performance in the exam.• Difficulty in Assessing Mastery: Evaluating students' mastery of content in OBEs can be challenging for educators, as the open-book format may mask deficiencies in understanding. It may be difficult to differentiate between students who genuinely understand the material and those who simply know where to find the answers.• Risk of Academic Dishonesty: OBEs pose a higher risk of academic dishonesty, as students may be tempted to plagiarize or copy answers from external sources. Maintaining academic integrity and ensuring that students adhere to ethical standards during OBEs requires vigilant monitoring and implementation of robust proctoring measures.","Discussion Unveils Both Enthusiasm and Concerns Over OBE ImplementationMerits of Open Book Exams (OBE)Demerits of Open Book Exams (OBE)NEW DELHI: In a landmark move, the Central Board of Secondary Education ( CBSE ) convened in December 2023 to deliberate on the implementation of open book exams (OBE) for classes 9-12.
Sharma emphasized the necessity for CBSE to be well-prepared to address potential challenges that may arise during this initiative.
Emphasis was placed on cultivating higher-order thinking skills, including application, analysis, critical and creative thinking, and problem-solving.

Open Book Exams from around the world

Media reports suggest that the Central Board of Secondary Education ( CBSE ) is contemplating the implementation of Open Book Examinations (OBE) for students in Classes 9 to 12, aligning with the suggestions of the new National Curriculum Framework introduced last year. Sources indicate that the Board is planning a trial of Open Book tests in select schools for subjects like English, Mathematics, and Science for Classes 9 and 10, and English, Mathematics, and Biology for Classes 11 and 12.This trial aims to assess the time students require to finish such tests and gather feedback from stakeholders.It has been reported that the pilot programme is likely to be scheduled in November-December of this year. Following the pilot, the Board will evaluate whether or not to implement this form of assessment across all its schools for Classes 9 to 12. The pilot will primarily assess higher-order thinking skills, including application, analysis, critical and creative thinking, as well as problem-solving abilities.The Board aims to finalize the design and development of the OBE pilot by June and has chosen to seek advice from Delhi University (DU). Despite facing opposition, DU implemented open-book tests in August 2020 during the Covid pandemic, which had caused disruptions to the academic calendar.An Open Book Exam is a type of assessment where students are allowed to consult their textbooks, notes, and other reference materials during the test. Unlike traditional closed-book exams, which rely on memorization, Open Book Exams emphasize comprehension, application, and critical thinking skills. These exams are often used in higher education settings, particularly in subjects where understanding concepts and applying knowledge is more important than rote memorization.One of the main benefits of open-book exams is that they encourage students to delve deeper into the material. Instead of simply regurgitating facts, students must understand the underlying concepts and be able to apply them to different scenarios. This promotes a deeper level of learning and can lead to a better understanding of the subject matter.Another advantage of Open Book Exams is that they can reduce stress levels for students. Since they are allowed to use their notes and textbooks, students may feel more confident in their ability to answer the questions. This can lead to a more relaxed testing environment and a more positive overall experience.Open Book Exams, while beneficial in promoting deeper understanding and reducing stress, present several challenges for both students and educators. Here are five of them for you.This format requires careful preparation and organization. Students must anticipate the types of questions that may be asked and ensure they have relevant materials readily accessible. This can be time-consuming and may lead to information overload, as students try to bring too many resources into the exam environment.OBE can be misleading in terms of preparation. Some students may underestimate the level of understanding required, assuming they can rely solely on their materials. As a result, they may not study the material as thoroughly as they would for a closed-book exam, leading to lower performance.This format can also present challenges in terms of time management. Students may spend too much time searching for information in their materials, leaving them with insufficient time to answer all the questions or to think critically about their responses.There is a risk of plagiarism or cheating in OBEs, especially if students are not closely monitored. With access to a wide range of resources, some students may be tempted to copy answers or use unauthorized materials, compromising the integrity of the assessment.Open Book Exams may not be suitable for all subjects or learning outcomes. Some disciplines require a level of memorization and recall that open-book exams do not encourage. Additionally, certain skills, such as problem-solving or critical thinking, may be more effectively assessed through closed-book formats that challenge students to apply knowledge without external aids.OBEs are used in various forms around the world, each tailored to the specific requirements of different subjects and educational systems. Here are five examples of how open-book exams are implemented.In law schools, open-book exams are common due to the emphasis on understanding legal principles and applying them to hypothetical scenarios. Students are allowed to bring in their textbooks, notes, and other materials. These exams typically consist of complex legal scenarios or case studies, and students must analyze the facts, identify relevant laws, and apply them to the situation to argue their case.In Germany, open-book exams are used in engineering courses, where students are required to solve complex engineering problems. They are allowed to bring in reference materials, such as formula sheets and textbooks. The exams are designed to test students' problem-solving abilities and their understanding of engineering concepts, rather than their ability to memorize formulas.In medical schools in Australia, Open Book Exams are used to assess students' clinical reasoning skills. Students are allowed access to patient case studies and they can also refer to medical textbooks and research articles to diagnose the condition and recommend treatment. These exams simulate real-world medical practice, where doctors often consult reference materials to make informed decisions.In the UK, OBEs are sometimes used in economics courses, particularly in essay-based assessments. Students are allowed to bring in relevant economic theories and data to support their arguments in essays. These exams focus on students' ability to critically analyze economic issues and develop well-supported arguments, rather than memorizing economic concepts.In some universities in India, Open Book Exams are used in computer science courses to test students' programming skills. Students are allowed to use their laptops and access the internet to write code and solve programming problems. These exams assess their ability to apply programming concepts to solve real-world problems and encourage them to use online resources effectively.","Unlike traditional closed-book exams, which rely on memorization, Open Book Exams emphasize comprehension, application, and critical thinking skills.

Beware of Unrealistic Claims

Fake universities in India and abroad are tricking students and parents with false promises of a good education. Despite what they say, these schools are hurting the futures of innocent students just to make a quick profit. The University Grants Commission recently put out a list of these fake universities in India.Enrolling in a fake university can lead to serious consequences.Graduates from these institutions don't get a recognised degree, making them ineligible for jobs requiring a college education or forcing them to accept lower salaries.Moreover, students attending fake universities may end up wasting their time and money. These institutions often charge excessive tuition fees without delivering a quality education. Students may also find themselves paying for fees and services that they never actually receive.Choosing the right university is a crucial decision, and unfortunately, fake colleges and universities are attempting to deceive innocent students and parents. But don't worry – there are ways to identify these impostors and ensure your safety.Here are 7 easy steps to help you identify fake universities and colleges:The first and foremost step is to ensure whether the university or college is accredited by a recognised accrediting body. For instance, In India, the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) is a major accreditation body. A genuine university will prominently display its accreditation logos on its website and official documents.Note:A credible university is often identified by having a well-designed and professional website. Keep an eye out for signs like unprofessional layouts, grammatical mistakes, typos, and outdated information. Be cautious if you come across websites that use too many stock photos and generic content.A genuine university will have a well-qualified and experienced faculty, and their credentials can be verified. You can check the university's website or contact them directly to inquire about the qualifications and research experience of the faculty members.Students and parents can connect with former and current students of the particular educational institute on social media or online forums to hear about their personal experiences. Their insights can provide valuable information about the university's credibility and overall quality.Look into the contact information like addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses to ensure they are correct and easy to find. Legitimate institutions provide trustworthy and comprehensive contact details.Watch out for institutions that make overwhelming promises, such as guaranteeing quick degrees, providing top-notch programmes at unusually low fees, or assuring immediate success.","Check for AccreditationIf you're thinking about studying abroad, you can confirm the accreditation by comparing the details on the college or university's website with the information on the Department of Education's website for that specific country.

A college degree has long been perceived as the gateway to secure government jobs. However, several government positions welcome candidates based on specialized skills, certifications, or specific qualifications rather than a formal higher education degree. Here are 15 such promising government jobs that do not necessarily require a college degree.Becoming a postal service mail carrier offers a stable government job without the need for a college degree.This role involves delivering mail and parcels in specified areas. Candidates typically need a high school diploma and a clean driving record.TSA officers work in airports, ensuring the safety and security of passengers. A high school diploma or equivalent, along with specialized training and passing a background check, qualifies candidates for this role.CBP officers safeguard borders and enforce customs regulations. While a degree might enhance opportunities, a high school diploma combined with specialized training and passing a rigorous examination can qualify candidates for this challenging yet rewarding role.Working in correctional facilities as a correctional officer involves maintaining security and order among inmates. Many agencies accept candidates with a high school diploma, with further training provided on the job.Firefighting roles in local fire departments often require a high school diploma, physical fitness, and completion of firefighter training programs conducted by the department.EMTs and paramedics provide immediate medical care in emergencies. A high school diploma and completion of a state-approved emergency medical technician training program are typically the prerequisites for this role.Air traffic controllers manage the movement of aircraft in the sky and at airports. While a degree might be advantageous, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) offers training programs that, coupled with relevant work experience or military service, can qualify candidates for this critical role.Library technicians assist librarians in various tasks, including organizing materials and helping patrons. Often, a high school diploma combined with some specialized training or experience in library science suffices for this position.Working as an electrician or plumber in government facilities often requires technical training, apprenticeships, and licensure rather than a college degree. These professionals maintain and repair essential systems within government buildings.The Railway Recruitment Board conducts exams for Group C (non-technical) and Group D (track maintenance, porter, helper) positions in the Indian Railways. These roles don't mandate a college degree, offering employment opportunities to individuals with Class 10 or 12 qualifications.The defense sector provides various opportunities for individuals without a degree. Positions like Soldiers (General Duty), Sailors, and Airmen offer avenues to serve the nation based on specific educational qualifications and skill sets.SSC conducts exams like Combined Higher Secondary Level (CHSL) and Multi-Tasking Staff (MTS) for roles in clerical, assistant, and support staff positions across government departments.Organizations like the Border Security Force (BSF), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), and others conduct recruitment for roles like Constables, Tradesmen, and Assistant Commandants where educational qualifications up to Class 12 are considered.Several government-run organizations offer apprenticeships in trades like electrician, plumber, carpenter, and more. These programs provide practical training without the necessity of a formal degree.Some clerical positions in public sector banks, like Bank Clerk and Bank Assistant, may not require a degree, particularly in cases where the candidate possesses strong numerical and clerical skills.Government jobs without a college degree offer a pathway to meaningful careers for individuals with diverse skill sets and interests. These roles not only provide stability and competitive salaries but also contribute significantly to public service. Aspiring candidates should focus on developing relevant skills, gaining experience, and pursuing necessary certifications to thrive in these rewarding government job opportunities.","However, several government positions welcome candidates based on specialized skills, certifications, or specific qualifications rather than a formal higher education degree.

263,JEE Advanced 2024: 10 preparation mistakes to avoid,"Here are 10 critical mistakes to avoid during JEE Advanced 2024 preparation:

1) Not starting your preparation early enough

2) Lack of a Proper

Study Plan

3) Unfamiliarity with the

Official Syllabus

READ ALSO:

4) Focusing only on memorizing concepts

5) Not practicing enough

6) Neglecting the Chemistry Section

7) Not Referring to NCERT Books

8) Disregarding

Negative Marking

9) Not taking care of your health

10) Not seeking help when you need it

The JEE Advanced 2024 , scheduled for May 26, 2024, demands dedicated preparation, especially for those who qualify among the top 2,50,000 ranks in the JEE Main 2024 exam. Success in both JEE Main and JEE Advanced is imperative for securing a coveted spot in the prestigious IITs. As the journey to secure a seat in an IIT requires meticulous planning, candidates must steer clear of common pitfalls.The JEE Advanced is a very competitive exam, and it is important to start your preparation early enough to give yourself enough time to cover the vast amount of material that is tested. Aim to start your preparation at least a year before the exam.Developing a well-organized study plan is paramount for JEE Advanced preparation. Candidates, especially those transitioning from JEE Main, should establish a clear study schedule to cover the syllabus effectively and avoid last-minute rushes.Ignoring the official JEE Advanced syllabus is a prevalent mistake. Candidates must align their preparation with the prescribed syllabus provided by the National Testing Agency and IITs. Understanding the exam pattern is equally crucial for effective preparation.While memorization is important, it is not enough to succeed in the JEE Advanced. You need to understand the concepts behind the formulas and equations in order to apply them correctly to solve problems.The only way to improve your problem-solving skills is to practice regularly. Solve as many problems as you can from the previous year's question papers and practice tests.Underestimating the importance of the Chemistry section is a significant error. Despite some students finding it less engaging, a well-prepared Chemistry section can contribute to scoring well. Devoting ample time to this section can be advantageous.Overlooking NCERT books is a common oversight. These books serve as foundational study material, aligning with the official syllabus. Many direct questions in JEE Advanced have been observed to come from NCERT books in previous years.Overconfidence in tackling complex questions without considering negative markings is a critical mistake.

266,Edtech: Ways in which AI can lead to disruption of the EdTech sector,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is perhaps the buzzword today in the digital technological domain. AI, the intelligence that can be exhibited by machines, performs various tasks by perceiving minutely its environment and taking actions that enhance the possibilities of achieving the required goals. These attributes can be of great help in the education sector too and have huge potential to disrupt the already existing EdTech tools.

Automation

of routine activities performed by teacher:

Currently, teachers have to spend an enormous amount of time evaluating and assessing homework, assignments and exam papers

A.I. can be extremely useful at this point by automating such activities and giving productive tips and inputs to the educator to ease their tasks

It can act as a virtual live-assistant for the teachers and provide real-time input to for choosing the right approach for the students

This will provide teachers with much more time to devote to teaching, clearing doubts and simplifying concepts and helping out students

Customised solutions for every student:

Lack of personalised attention and approach has always been a persisting problem in a huge class as it's time-consuming and impractical for any teacher

AI’s high processing power can prove to be a boon in such a scenario and adjust the learning needs of the students by building student profiles, reading expressions and modifying ongoing lessons accordingly

It can further help in recognising and differentiating the weaknesses and strengths of the students by the following features:

By synchronising to an individual's level of knowledge and pace of learning

By adapting to other details like goals and learning histories of the students

Approaching studies with such AI-based customised solutions can enable children to follow a learning path that suits them best rather than trying to fit in others’ shoes

Provide a self-learning platform:

AI can increase the engagement and interest of the students in their studies and the learning process by acquainting them accurately with their learning parameters

It can make them self-aware and increase motivation in learning and encourage them to carry out learning even in the absence or less involvement of the educators

This can ensure in the long term lesser dropout rates

Instrumental for physically-different students:

AI research is being carried out for providing communication solutions through chatbots, real-time language translation apps and plug-ins for the hearing impaired and those facing issues in language

Artificial intelligence (AI) is perhaps the buzzword today in the digital technological domain. AI, the intelligence that can be exhibited by machines, performs various tasks by perceiving minutely its environment and taking actions that enhance the possibilities of achieving the required goals. These attributes can be of great help in the education sector too and have huge potential to disrupt the already existing EdTech tools.It will reorient and transform the way students and teachers have been operating in the learning process. A research market engine has even predicted the use of A.I. to grow annually in education by 45%.A look at the major ways in which AI can disrupt the existing EdTech sector :The AI’s potential for disruption can be evinced by the fact that this technology is designed and created to perform reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects. In everyday life AI is popularly used in the form of voice assistant, image recognition and face unlock in Android phones, natural language processing and ML-based financial fraud detection. Currently, research is also being conducted on improving student-teacher compatibility or improving the understanding between teachers and students.","Artificial intelligence (AI) is perhaps the buzzword today in the digital technological domain.

267,How useful is Artificial Intelligence in learning and teaching?,"Provides personalised and differentiated learning interface

Convenient tutoring and additional support

A global educational access

Timely feedback and correction

In the world of technology, one of the greatest inventions that has blown people’s minds is the genius of artificial intelligence (AI). A unique software invention, AI picks up stimulation from human intelligence and mimics it through machines. The programs generated through artificial intelligence produce real human-interested actions as they tend to think like humans.With this ultimate prowess and the ability to behave like humans, the inclusion of AI has seeped deep into our daily lives. The presence of AI has become inevitable, right from taking pictures to automated parking directions in the car, data analysis in business to the innovation of medicine. And now the benefits of AI have trickled into the field of education, making learning joyous. Right from making the most complex of subjects easy, to helping teachers with automatic grading and attendance, the integration of artificial intelligence has taken the understanding of education into the future and beyond. Here is how AI is making itself useful in learning and teaching In education, the convenience of artificial intelligence ensures custom-made study materials depending on a student’s needs. The educational software in artificial intelligence is capable of making adaptive learning technology, games, and programs for students that enhance the process of knowledge acquisition. The benefit of such a system lies in the simple fact that it ends up highlighting a student’s individualised needs around specific subject topics where they might feel stuck. This entire process, at the end of the day, also makes teaching less complicated, giving tutors the freedom to offer support to the students when in need.With AI-integrated courses and study materials, it leaves abundant time for the teachers to provide more attention to students individually. With AI, organisational and administrative tasks such as attendance counting, assembling resource materials, filling progress reports, evaluating homework, and grading tests can be automated, making the world more quick and efficient. In the current scenario, AI has reached the level of grading multiple-choice tests, but soon it will be able to grade written responses as well. In fact, there are already a few artificial intelligence-based tutoring programs that can teach basic mathematics, writing, and other subjects. These benefits of AI leave a huge space open for teachers to spend quality time with each student.Another major benefit of an artificial intelligence-based learning system is that it makes access to educational resources easy across borders. Through AI tools, learning becomes attainable for students with hearing and visual impairments, as well as for those coming from different language backgrounds. Software under AI provides students with real-time subtitles for everything the teacher is saying in the class. This urges the student to continue learning the subject further, which opens up new possibilities for them. At the same time, it offers knowledge and learning on subjects that otherwise might not be available in schools for the students.As AI technology provides consolidated study and course materials to students across the world, it also helps gain quick feedback. Being able to customise the needs of a student also allows for an immediate response to the functionality. Apart from tutoring students, the AI systems also assist teachers in identifying specific areas for improvement.The road to the future of education from here only leads to stress-free learning and teaching. Learning through artificial intelligence based on individual needs and understanding aids in enhanced performance.","Provides personalised and differentiated learning interfaceConvenient tutoring and additional supportA global educational accessTimely feedback and correctionIn the world of technology, one of the greatest inventions that has blown people’s minds is the genius of artificial intelligence (AI).

268,What is UNESCO’s 10-plan strategy for distance learning solutions?,"Ensuring

digital

preparedness and choosing the most relevant tools:

The educational institutes should zero in on the right technology, whether high-end or acreage depending on the local internet connectivity, power supply, and digital skills of teachers and students

This would include integrated video lessons, digital learning platforms, and Massive Open Online Courses(MOOCs) for broadcasting through radios and TVs

Inclusiveness in distance learning programmes:

Distance learning programmes should ensure the inclusion and access of students with disabilities, special needs, and the ones from marginalised sections

The devices can be temporarily decentralised from computer labs to families to ensure internet connectivity in case of limited devices

Ensuring data security and privacy:

Data security should be assessed properly while uploading and sharing educational content on the learning apps, with students and other organisations

It should be ensured that the use of these applications and platforms does not violate students’ data privacy

Planned study schedule:

Study schedules should be planned to keep in mind the interests, availability of parents, school closure, and total duration of schools

Furthermore, the situation of the affected zones in times of crisis, the level of studies, and the needs of students should also be considered

Training the educators and parents in using digital tools:

Brief training sessions should be organised for teachers and parents to help them monitor their children when needed

Teachers should be trained for doing basic settings, using internet data, live streaming lessons, etc

Blending learning approaches :

The tools that are commonly available for the majority of students for both synchronous communication and lessons, and for asynchronous learning

Teachers should limit the usage of applications and platforms, and not burden parents and students with downloading many educational apps

Developing and defining distance learning rules:

The rules for distance learning courses should be developed and defined after discussing them with parents and students on distance learning

The methodology should include formative questions, tests, and exercises to closely monitor the learning process of students

Tools that support the submission of students’ feedback should be used instead of asking parents to scan and send the feedback

Fixing the duration of distance learning units based on students’ self-regulation skills:

A practically viable timing should be set according to the cognitive abilities and self-regulation of the students

The learning units should be recommended to be not more than 20 minutes, and not more than 40 minutes for secondary school students

Create communities and enhance connection:

To address the issues of isolation, helplessness, and anxiety among both children and parents, communities of teachers, parents, and school managers should be created

Parents should be encouraged to share their experiences in coping with distance learning strategies and facing learning difficulties

The onset of the pandemic brought many changes in the mode of education for schools and colleges. This led many international organisations, private sectors, and government agencies to ensure the continuity of education remotely. However, the design and delivery of distance learning should also reach everyone irrespective of social inequalities. UNESCO published in April 2020, a comprehensive 10-plan guideline and strategy for effective distance learning.Some of the important guidelines in this 10-plan strategy are the following:Currently, many governmental agencies are working with global and private organisations and civil society to impart education remotely by combining various technologies.","Ensuringdigitalpreparedness and choosing the most relevant tools:The educational institutes should zero in on the right technology, whether high-end or acreage depending on the local internet connectivity, power supply, and digital skills of teachers and studentsThis would include integrated video lessons, digital learning platforms, and Massive Open Online Courses(MOOCs) for broadcasting through radios and TVsInclusiveness in distance learning programmes:Distance learning programmes should ensure the inclusion and access of students with disabilities, special needs, and the ones from marginalised sectionsThe devices can be temporarily decentralised from computer labs to families to ensure internet connectivity in case of limited devicesEnsuring data security and privacy:Data security should be assessed properly while uploading and sharing educational content on the learning apps, with students and other organisationsIt should be ensured that the use of these applications and platforms does not violate students’ data privacyPlanned study schedule:Study schedules should be planned to keep in mind the interests, availability of parents, school closure, and total duration of schoolsFurthermore, the situation of the affected zones in times of crisis, the level of studies, and the needs of students should also be consideredTraining the educators and parents in using digital tools:Brief training sessions should be organised for teachers and parents to help them monitor their children when neededTeachers should be trained for doing basic settings, using internet data, live streaming lessons, etcBlending learning approaches :The tools that are commonly available for the majority of students for both synchronous communication and lessons, and for asynchronous learningTeachers should limit the usage of applications and platforms, and not burden parents and students with downloading many educational appsDeveloping and defining distance learning rules:The rules for distance learning courses should be developed and defined after discussing them with parents and students on distance learningThe methodology should include formative questions, tests, and exercises to closely monitor the learning process of studentsTools that support the submission of students’ feedback should be used instead of asking parents to scan and send the feedbackFixing the duration of distance learning units based on students’ self-regulation skills:A practically viable timing should be set according to the cognitive abilities and self-regulation of the studentsThe learning units should be recommended to be not more than 20 minutes, and not more than 40 minutes for secondary school studentsCreate communities and enhance connection:To address the issues of isolation, helplessness, and anxiety among both children and parents, communities of teachers, parents, and school managers should be createdParents should be encouraged to share their experiences in coping with distance learning strategies and facing learning difficultiesThe onset of the pandemic brought many changes in the mode of education for schools and colleges.

Student assessment is a good progress indicator and with E-learning a prevalent medium, teachers need to know and check the process of assessment. It is an essential part of effective teaching too in an online learning atmosphere. Assessment evaluates and improves learning by challenging students to look back on what is learned; it also helps to apply knowledge to answer and solve problems.Now that online learning is a standard learning method, it is important to know the evaluation approaches. Different approaches are designed to assess children online; the ultimate goal is to see where the child stands from an academic point of view and how many lessons are retained.The two major approaches of assessment include formative and summative assessment. Formative assessment judges strengths and weaknesses. For every lesson, the feedback received helps to improve the teaching process. Whereas in the summative assessment, the approach is to test the retention after the lessons are taught and improvements are made. this is in a way a test of the instruction materialLet’s see the top 5 ways to assess a child during E-learning:Quizzing is the simplest form of assessment. This determines the engagement of the child. Multiple choice and gap-filling are the easiest forms. Quizzes can be designed time-based. With the online facility, the set of questions can be made unique. Overall, it is easy to create and analyse the result. Further, with unique question sets, cheating is preventedEssay writing or open-ended questions are good assessors and a good opportunity for students to organise their thoughts and opinions. The students are encouraged to create a comprehensive answer and test what is learned. A child’s critical thinking is also checked through open-ended questions.Polls are easy-to-get answers or feedback about students' learning experiences. Students are asked to give opinions about the lessons or courses, their interests and dislikes. Digital platforms provide easy methods to write questions in the form.A session of real-life conversations is a great way to improve communication skills. Students learn conversations with peers, customers and colleagues. Learners are challenged in real-time situations such as concept presentation, application of a theory, selling a product, or assigning or managing a task. This way, they learn to prepare for an interview that they might face in the near future. The way the students handle the conversation, prepares them to reflect on their problem-solving skills.Students themselves creating and presenting the concepts or explaining topics is a good way to learn a topic and make others learn the same. Students presenting explain the whole class, and receive feedback from their peers and the teachers. Web conferencing tools provide great facilities for this.Forum post assessments include sharing everyone's opinions to understand, favour or argue the points of the classmates. Discussion topics for students can be created along with guidelines to answer. This way, the level of understanding and participation can be checked.Assessment is always required to check how far the path has been covered and how good the journey has been. Just as traditional schooling, e-learning has some great methods to assess students and rate their performance and growth. To keep the child's growth in check and to help in their overall development, assessment during E-learning is very important.","Forum post DiscussionsStudent assessment is a good progress indicator and with E-learning a prevalent medium, teachers need to know and check the process of assessment.

In this method, both computer algorithms and artificial intelligence are used to conduct interaction with the learner and deliver customised resources and learning activities according to the varying needs of the learners Individualised learning : This method involves orienting content, instructional technology, and pace of learning according to the abilities and interests of each learner

This method involves orienting content, instructional technology, and pace of learning according to the abilities and interests of each learner Competency-based learning: This learning approach focuses on the progress of the students at their own pace and level of knowledge

Learning through online platforms:

ML algorithms help to analyse the online course content, identify whether the information is relevant to the current standards, and analyse if the learners can understand what they learn

This is done by asking students to answer some questions that help to get fair knowledge about their interests, pace of understanding, and level of knowledge

This in turn helps to design customised courses and relevant materials on demand

All-round mobile learning :

ML-enabled educational apps have made it possible to access educational content whenever one wants and have enabled 24x7 mobile learning

These apps use various parameters and learning behaviour to increase the engagement of students and improve their overall learning experience by personalising the content

Duolingo is an app that uses ML to predict the probability of remembering certain words or phrases. When the app detects that the user frequently misses these words or phrases, it recommends practising them until they become proficient

Advanced grading:

Evaluation is an important part of any learning and ML helps achieve this by allowing teachers to identify those who need attention and detect the weak areas of the learners

The progress monitoring ML tools help track the growth and evaluate lessons in an individual-centric way to find out the solution that works best for the student

The University of California at Berkeley has created an evaluation tool, Gradescope , which evaluates and grades the student's work in some courses

, which evaluates and grades the student's work in some courses Using this tool, the teachers can know about the actual level of students' knowledge by first setting the assessment parameters and by adjusting multiple settings for each course

The three kinds of approaches to personalised learning are the following:A look at the educational methods through which ML ensures personalised learning:Besides these methods, ML is commonly used for classwork personalisation, which includes tracing students’ comprehension of the material and tracking the time spent on homework.","['learning', 'students', 'pace', 'method', 'help', 'machine', 'educational', 'personalised', 'ensure', 'content', 'according', 'ml', 'does']",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/online-schooling/how-does-machine-learning-ensure-personalised-learning-for-students/articleshow/96049412.cms
271,Applications of the metaverse in imparting education in schools,"Enhancing and transforming students the experience of the internet:

The schools can use metaverse to take students on n realistic field trips to prominent places in both present and historical ways

This will help make the field trips extremely engaging and enhance the experience of the students manifold

The students can also select the items and interact with historical events and visit the battlefield of a particular war and watch it as a spectator or become one of the characters

Such an approach and experience can give a way to a deeper level of learning than just reading books

Metaverse ensures thus learning engagingly in a safer environment

Connecting students around the world easily:

Metaverse can be employed to connect students from across the globe

This can be achieved by using metaverse as a tool for live translations of foreign languages for the diverse group of students, thus making it easier for them to communicate and converse

Metaverse can help in expanding the capabilities of AI and the interactive element in it can help to break down the barriers of language, culture, and locations

This can help the students to gain the desired knowledge directly and help satisfy their imagination and inquisitiveness

For explaining concepts vividly:

The immersive learning environment of the metaverse makes it achievable to present scientific concepts in a real-time manner

For instance, with the help of the metaverse, one can walk through the solar system, experience the movement of heavenly bodies or closely watch the principle behind launching rockets

The real movements of the objects in a real scenario in a 3D virtual environment help in grabbing the minutest of details and steps behind a process

Students can also practice a certain skill or experiment like dissecting frogs in the lab or doing astrophysics experiments

Virtual campus activities:

The students can participate in ongoing real events, competitions, and educational clubs through the virtual environment of the metaverse

It makes one feel like being physically present on campus and helps one to not miss any important happening because of not being physically available

Ever since Mark Zuckerberg rechristened and reoriented his social media firm Facebook as Meta , this new concept gained instant and immense attention and prominence. Metaverse has been predicted to reach a commercial market worth $800bn by 2024 according to a report published in Bloomberg . This is bound to take metaverse to schools and universities and embed it in the education system.Let's explore the out-of-the-box avenues that metaverse can open in teaching in schools.Before jumping on to the various applications of the metaverse in school education, it's important to reckon with the potential of the metaverse. This new version of the internet incorporates and builds and improves upon the existing technologies like virtual and augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and advanced hardware that allows the users to experience an immersive internet rather than just using it.Now a look at the various applications of the metaverse:Metaverse does away with the limitations of space and time and allows for holistic learning by assimilating the most innovatively theoretical concepts with practical implications.","Enhancing and transforming students the experience of the internet:The schools can use metaverse to take students on n realistic field trips to prominent places in both present and historical waysThis will help make the field trips extremely engaging and enhance the experience of the students manifoldThe students can also select the items and interact with historical events and visit the battlefield of a particular war and watch it as a spectator or become one of the charactersSuch an approach and experience can give a way to a deeper level of learning than just reading booksMetaverse ensures thus learning engagingly in a safer environmentConnecting students around the world easily:Metaverse can be employed to connect students from across the globeThis can be achieved by using metaverse as a tool for live translations of foreign languages for the diverse group of students, thus making it easier for them to communicate and converseMetaverse can help in expanding the capabilities of AI and the interactive element in it can help to break down the barriers of language, culture, and locationsThis can help the students to gain the desired knowledge directly and help satisfy their imagination and inquisitivenessFor explaining concepts vividly:The immersive learning environment of the metaverse makes it achievable to present scientific concepts in a real-time mannerFor instance, with the help of the metaverse, one can walk through the solar system, experience the movement of heavenly bodies or closely watch the principle behind launching rocketsThe real movements of the objects in a real scenario in a 3D virtual environment help in grabbing the minutest of details and steps behind a processStudents can also practice a certain skill or experiment like dissecting frogs in the lab or doing astrophysics experimentsVirtual campus activities:The students can participate in ongoing real events, competitions, and educational clubs through the virtual environment of the metaverseIt makes one feel like being physically present on campus and helps one to not miss any important happening because of not being physically availableEver since Mark Zuckerberg rechristened and reoriented his social media firm Facebook as Meta , this new concept gained instant and immense attention and prominence.

274,Schools in Wales opt for teaching online a week to deal with rising energy costs,"The Powys Councillor, Beverley Baynaham recently raised the issue of considering all the possible options for savings in the schools of Powys, Wales in the UK. The council said it is focussing on the issue of cutting costs and saving energy and looking for solutions in this direction. The ideas were raised at the council meeting which was held to brief the head teachers and chair of governors at Powys.The officers suggested the council shift to online teaching once a week to deal with the rising energy costs. They suggested that some schools in Wales can choose to conduct weekly online classes to achieve potential savings.Councillor Pete Roberts , the minister responsible for education said that blended weeks of learning can also be considered in extreme cases. Furthermore, it was suggested to have a four-day week with the fifth day being taught virtually at home. However, no clear directive would be given to the schools to do this.l according to the council cabinet member. A financial toolkit has also been prepared and shared with schools to help headteachers and school governors to tackle financial issues. Roberts further informed that the council has been helping the schools by carrying out finance surgeries and scrutinising the budgets for looking at spending patterns and giving suggestions for potential solutions.Besides online classes, the officers suggested that the vacant positions for the school's teachers in Powys should be filled and shifted temporarily to the existing staff members. The other suggestions included finding volunteers to work in schools. The decision to implement either of these suggestions or not will solely rest upon the headteacher and their chair of governors. Roberts said that there cannot be a single solution for the schools so they will decide which option is most viable for their school budget.","The Powys Councillor, Beverley Baynaham recently raised the issue of considering all the possible options for savings in the schools of Powys, Wales in the UK.
